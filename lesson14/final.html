<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>For this part of the project, make sure to review any feedback you have received on your DryOar website and make any corrections or enhancements to make sure it looks and functions great. Make sure all images display and all links either work or do nothing. Make sure there are no spelling errors as well.</p>
<p>For review here are the requirements from the syllabus.</p>
<p>The following are the specific requirements of the Web site: The Web site must consist of a main page and at least 2 child pages. The Web site must be published to the web (if it's in Updog this is done). Each of the 3 pages of your Web site must satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 22px;">Significant content consisting of both text and a minimum of one image. You need to make sure this page has the appropriate content for your audience so that they can understand the meaning and message of this site.</span></li>
<li>Working links to the all of the other pages you have created.</li>
<li>Be visually appealing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>For this part of the project, you are required to type a final report using Word, Pages, or PDF, detailing the design and development of your completed Web site. Your report must be at least 500 words.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Design Process (5 pts)</h4>

</ul>
<h4>Conclusion (5 pts)</h4>
