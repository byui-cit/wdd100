<p>Estimated Time: 45 minutes</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>Nothing makes a webpage feel like more of a product and less of a project than changing from the default fonts. You should have chosen one or two fonts when you were putting the site plan together for your site. Go review that now.</p>
<p>If you chose fonts from among the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp" target="_blank">web-safe list</a>&nbsp;then you can use them just like Khan academy showed you this week. (Here is another list of the web-safe fonts:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cssfontstack.com/</a>)</p>
<p>If you chose fonts from Google Fonts or elsewhere then we have to make the font available to the web page first before we can use them.</p>
<p>No matter which fonts you are using it is always a good idea to list some fall-back fonts, in case for some reason your first choice doesn't work correctly...you can control how it degrades. Your second choice should be similar to your first (and usually web-safe), the third font in the list should usually be one of the default font families. (serif, san-serif, fantasy, monospace, or script)</p>
<p>So for example if I chose Helvetica&nbsp;as my font for body copy I would add something like&nbsp;<kbd>font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</kbd>&nbsp;to a rule modifying the&nbsp;<kbd>body</kbd> of my page.</p>
<p>If however I wanted to use the font Rock Salt for my headlines, that is not a web safe font and will probably not be on most computers. I have to do an extra step to make it available.</p>
<p>Google Fonts makes it very easy to add your fonts. Find your font in Google Fonts and click the red plus: Select this Font</p>
<div class="fig-block">
    <figure><img src="../images/googlefont1-new.jpg" alt="googlefont" title="googlefont" /></figure>
</div>
<p>Then find the black bar on the bottom of your screen and click on it to expand it. Then click on the "@import" tab.</p>
<div class="fig-block">
    <figure><img src="../images/googlefont2-new.jpg" alt="googlefont2" title="googlefont2" /></figure>
</div>
    <p>Copy the line that starts with '@import' and add it to the <strong>top</strong> of your &lt;style&gt; block. It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My first website&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
          @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rock+Salt);
           ...            
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use that font just like normal, ie:&nbsp;<kbd>font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive;</kbd></p>
</div>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>Based on your font choices from your site plan, add the appropriate&nbsp;<kbd>font-family:</kbd>, and&nbsp;<kbd>@import</kbd>&nbsp;lines to your CSS to change the body font and headline font on your webpage.</p>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Often the default font sizes are fine...but there are times when they need to be changed. For example it's good for the links used for navigation to be nice and easy to click, so lets increase their size. Let's make it 110% of normal. (Remember the 'em' unit of measurement for fonts. 1em = the normal size of your font...so 1.1em = 110%)</p>
<div class="callout" style="overflow:auto;"><img src="../images/paddingexample.jpg" alt="paddingexample" title="paddingexample" class="right" />
<p>Nice to have those fonts in there :) Now though notice what is happening anywhere that you have made colored boxes around anything. Here is an example:</p>
<p>The font and image are pressed right up against the edge of the border and it looks...not great. Lets fix it.</p>
<p>The space between the content in a box and the edge of a box is called <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding.asp" target="_blank">padding</a>. We can add padding to one or all sides. for example if I wanted to add some padding to all 4 sides of the box I would do something like this:&nbsp;<kbd>padding: 1em;</kbd>&nbsp;(We will learn more about padding next week)</p>
</div>
<h3>Step 03</h3>
<p>Use <kbd>padding</kbd> to space out the content on your page from any edges or borders where it is needed.</p>
<h3>Step 04</h3>
<p>Proximity is a design principle that we rely on to help to know which elements on our page are related to each other by their distance from each other. Let's make sure that visitors to our site know that the headlines and paragraphs are related to each other by bringing them a little closer together. (The default spacing has them just a little far apart.) Adjust the&nbsp;<kbd>line-height</kbd>&nbsp; and <kbd>margin</kbd>s of your headlines to bring them closer to the paragraphs they belong to. You could even play with the line-height of your paragraphs to see how it affects readability as well.</p>
<div class="callout">
    <p>If you are having a hard time getting your headlines to come closer to your paragraphs try this: right click on one of your headlines and select "Inspect".  An area on your browser should open at either the side or bottom of the screen that shows both the html and the styles for that element.  This is a powerful tool.</p>
    <p>When I did this I saw the following:</p>
    <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure><img src="../images/inspect.jpg" alt="inspect element example"  />
                    </figure>
                    
     </div>
     <ol>
         <li>Notice that browser is showing me the size of the element in pixels.</li>
         <li>It's also showing me the area it takes up both for size (blue highlight) and margins (brown highlight). If there were any padding it would be green.</li>
         <li>All the styles are shown.  The third arrow shows styles I defined.</li>
         <li>The last arrow shows several styles I <strong>did not</strong> define.  Notice it says "user agent stylesheet" That's just another way of saying "browser default styling".</li>
     </ol><figure class="right"><img src="../images/box-model.jpg" alt="box model example"  /><figcaption>Box Model for the element</figcaption></figure>
     <p>The highlighted area and the styles are both showing in different ways that <kbd>&lt;h2&gt;</kbd> has top and bottom margins defined by default. Those defaults are probably interfering with your desire to move the headline closer to the paragraph.</p>
     
     <p>Another way of seeing this can be found if you scroll down in the area showing the styles...you should see something like in the Box model figure.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout">
<p>If you refer back to the wireframe you will notice that the paragraphs in each of the sections only take up about half the screen. Let's make them do that now. We can use the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp" target="_blank">width</a>&nbsp;property again to do this. You should have placed the headline and paragraph together in a box and given it a class to identify it. If you didn't do that now. My code looks like this:</p>
<div class="fig-block">
    <figure><img src="../images/codeexample.jpg" alt="codeexample" title="codeexample" /></figure>
    </div>
<p>It might be helpful to review the&nbsp;<a href="../images/wireframe-boxes.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;I am basing my page on. Notice how I have grouped and identified things. I placed the headline, and paragraph in the first section (top-row) in a &lt;div&gt; with a class of leftcol, then I use that same class for the left column in the second section (middle-row). Then I did the same thing for the content that will be in the right column (once we learn positioning). This was part of last week's assignment.</p>
<p>If yours doesn't look similar to this you might want to adjust it. Layout will go much easier if your HTML is well structured. Think of a body and skeleton. If the bones in your elbows bent backwards instead of forwards you could scratch your own back easily, but you would have a really hard time eating :) You could get it done, but it's better to have a structure that makes it easy. Poor HTML structure will make positioning and laying out your site&nbsp;<strong>much</strong>&nbsp;more work.</p>
</div>
<h3>Step 05</h3>
<p>Review your wireframe and set widths for elements that need it. In my example I would set a width of 48% on the left and right columns, and bottom section to constrain them to a bit less than half the space they have available.</p>
<h3>Step 06</h3>
<p>Open your website&nbsp;into your browser to make sure the web page displays correctly. Pay special attention to whether your images are all displaying. Once verified, submit the URL for your page to iLearn.&nbsp;Then remember to backup your Handcraft files (Projects-&gt;Gear icon-&gt;Export as .zip).</p>
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">validate</a> your page as well and fix any errors that show.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>This activity will be graded using the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linked site shows examples of using font-family, font-size, line-height, width, and padding with classes or ids (6 pts)</li>
<li>Fonts of the webpage are changed from the default browser font and a series of 3 fonts have been indicated in the CSS to control how the font degrades if a desired font is not available. (3pts)</li>
<li>The HTML is well formed and without errors. (1 pt)</li>
</ul>
