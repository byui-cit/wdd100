            <h2>Activity Instructions</h2>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="highlight">Estimated Time</span>: 30 minutes</span>
            </p>
            <p><span>This week we will continue with the webpage we started  in the Getting started: Create the home page activity. Open up the index.html file from last week in Handcraft to begin.</span></p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 01</span>&nbsp;</h3>
            <p><span>First review the <a href="../images/wireframe-new.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;to help remember what we are trying to do. Notice that there are several elements on the page that are related and grouped. On this wireframe I added red boxes to help to see some of those relationships. We need to add some markup to make 'boxes' around those same elements in our html.</span></p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><span>Html has several tags specifically for this purpose. Some have specific semantic meanings and others don't. We should always try and use the ones with meaning whenever we can. Here is a list of some of the more common of these tags:&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;header&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;footer&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;main&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;article&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;aside&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>, and&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd></span></p>
                <p><span>All of them behave the same in the browser except for&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd>, but they are used to show different sections of the page. Try to use the more specific ones first, using a generic&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;only if none of the others seems to apply to the content you are boxing in.</span></p>
            </div>
            <h3><span><span class="highlight">Step 02</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3>
            <p><span>Let's add some boxes. First notice that the links are all related. Let's put them in a box. One of the tags I listed above is&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;it is specifically for designating navigational elements on a page. Let's wrap the list that contains our navigation in a&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd><kbd>&lt;/nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;element.</span></p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 03</span></h3>
            <p><span>Next notice on the wireframe that there are sections consisting of related headline, paragraph, and image. Let's group each of those and designate them as&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>s.</span></p>
            <p><span>Here is an example of how one of those sections should look:</span></p>
            <h2><span>Section Example</span></h2>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;We run Rivers to relax.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing...  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src="images\picture1.jpg" alt="picture of a river"&gt;    
&lt;/section&gt;
        </code>
        </pre>
            <h3><span><span class="highlight">Step 04</span></span></h3>
            <p><span>That's enough boxing for now. Let's add some styles. In the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;portion of our page let's add a&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;element.</span></p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 05</span></h3>
            <p><span>The wireframe has a rectangle around the navigation menu. This usually indicates a colored box in that area. Let's add some color to our&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>. In the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;style&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;block we added let's make a CSS rule modifying our&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd></span></p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><span>Every CSS rule is made up of 3 elements. First we always need a selector, in this case we want to modify any&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;elements on our page so our selector will be:&nbsp;<kbd>nav</kbd>. Next there are always curly braces { }. Inside those braces we place one or more pairs of 'property to change: value to change it to'</span></p>
                <p><span>So in this example to change the background color of our&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;after adding the new rule our style block would look like this: (you should use one of your selected colors, probably not salmon)</span></p>
                <pre>        <code class="html">
&lt;style&gt;
     nav {
         background-color: salmon;
     }    
&lt;/style&gt;
        </code>
        </pre>
                <p><span>It's worth taking a moment and talking about what valid options you have to designate color. The 3 main ways are hexadecimal, rgb, and predefined color names. Take a moment to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools: CSS colors</a>&nbsp;to get a brief outline about the differences. Also take a look at this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp" target="_blank">list of color names</a>&nbsp;that your browser will understand.</span></p>
            </div>
            <h3><span><span class="highlight">Step 06</span></span></h3>
            <p><span>The color you changed the background of the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;to may have made your text hard to read. In the site plan you should have chosen a color for your links. Add another line to your css rule to change the&nbsp;<kbd>color</kbd>&nbsp;for the text in the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;as well. Again you should use a color from your chosen palette. Pick something that looks good with the background color and that is easily readable.</span></p>
            <h3><span><span class="highlight">Step 07</span></span></h3>
            <p><span>Our next step is to add the background color to the second&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;in our page.</span></p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><span>We have a slight problem here though. If we use the tag as a selector like we did with&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;it will change both of our sections, which we don't want. From the Khan Academy lesson you should have learned about 2 other selectors: id selectors and class selectors. Id selectors should be used for elements that have unique styling needs, class selectors for those elements that might share styles with other elements. (I tend to use far more class selectors than id, I like re-using CSS rules)</span></p>
            </div>
            <p><span>In this case let's use an ID. Add an&nbsp;<kbd>id=""</kbd>&nbsp;to the second section so we can apply some styles just to that one. Pick a descriptive name for the id, then add a rule to change the background color of that box to one of your colors. (Remember that when you write the rule you need to add a '#' to your id name so the browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;and not the&nbsp;<em>tag</em>)</span></p>
            <h3><span><span class="highlight">Step 08</span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
            <p><span>Next let's make our headlines stand out a little more. Lets change the color of all headlines again to one of the colors in your palette. Since we need to make sure everything from&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;h6&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;gets the same styling we will take advantage of the fact that you can apply the same styles to more than one selector, so we can write one rule instead of six to change them all.</span></p>
            <p><span>To have a set of rules apply to more than one selector we separate them with a comma. So the rule to change the color of all headlines would look something like this:</span></p>
            <h2><span>Multiple selector Example</span></h2>
            <pre>        <code class="css">
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
     color: #6495ED;
}    
        </code>
        </pre>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 09</span></h3>
            <p>Changing the color of the second section may have made the text there hard to read. For our final step lets use a class selector to change the color of that text. Add a&nbsp;<kbd>class=""</kbd>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;inside the second section. Choose a descriptive name for the class, then create a css rule to change the color. Remember that you need to precede your rule with a '.' so that the browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;<em>class</em>&nbsp;and not a&nbsp;<em>tag</em>. If done correctly it should only change the text of the paragraph we applied the class to.</p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 10</span></h3>
            <p>Once you verify that the changes all look right,&nbsp;<em>submit the URL</em>&nbsp;from your browser for your page to iLearn.</p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 11</span></h3>
            <p>This is a good time to backup your work as well. In Handcraft click on projects (Top left corner of the screen if you are in the editor) then click the gear icon on the project that contains your website.  On the right side of the screen choose the "Export as .zip" option.  That will download a bundle that contains all the files in your project to your computer. If anything wwere to happen you could retrieve those files and restore them to Handcraft.</p>
