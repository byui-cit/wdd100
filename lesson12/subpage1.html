<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Estimated Time: 45 minutes</span></p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
For this assignment, choose one of the pages you identified last week and made wireframes for that you will complete as your first sub-page. A sub-page is a page with links back and forth to your main page.
<div class="callout">
<p>Want a shortcut? We know that many of the elements from our home page should also be on your child pages...header, navigation, footer, colors, etc. So use the <kbd>index.html</kbd> as a starting point. Make a new file in your editor and save it with a meaningful name (for example if I were making a contact page I would name my new file <kbd>contact.html</kbd>)...then copy and paste the code from your index.html into your new file, update the <kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd>, and delete the content that is specific to the home page and Voila! you have a great start on your new page.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>You do not want to create a new .css file for this new page. This could create a problem of having pages look different in important ways because the styles in one file were updated and not the other. You should only have <strong>one</strong> .css file for your entire site. Add any new styles for this new html page to the bottom of your existing .css.</p>
</div>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Open your website&nbsp;into your browser to make sure the web page displays correctly. Pay special attention to whether your images are all displaying. Once verified, submit the URL for your page to iLearn.&nbsp;Then remember to backup your Handcraft files (Projects-&gt;Gear icon-&gt;Export as .zip).</p>
<p>Go to the next page to access "W12.02 Sub-Page One Creation" and click "Upload". Make a note about which page you completed (so the instructor knows what to grade)</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>This activity will be graded using the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant textual content consisting of appropriate content for your audience so that they can understand the meaning and message of the page. (10 pts)</li>
<li>Working links to your main page and at least one of your other child pages. (5 pt)</li>
<li>Be visually appealing. (5 pts)</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<h3>What is meant by &ldquo;visually appealing?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>I wish there was a non-subjective way to measure this... but there isn't. Generally you only lose points for this with things that are obvious. For example, text that is difficult to read because it uses a color to similar to the background, a navigation bar that is directly against a banner or the text of the page rather than having some space around it, use of a color scheme that obviously indicates no thought was put into the color choices (this doesn't mean that you can't use white - it's more stating that if you just threw colors onto the page for the sake of throwing colors onto the page and it is obvious, you'll lose points), etc.</p>
    <p>If you simply copy/pasted the text from the content page in most cases it will <strong>not</strong> be visually appealing.  Make sure that you format it to make it more readable! Be generous with &lt;p&gt; tags, padding, margins, and maybe even &lt;ul&gt;s.  You <strong>will</strong> lose points on this if you do not put some thought into the readability of the text.</p>
<h3>What is considered &ldquo;significant content?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Each page of a website should clearly convey to the user what the page is for. If it is a main/home page, it should provide the user with enough information to know what your site is about, whether it contains the information/products they are looking for, and, thereby, whether they should stick around and keep looking through your website. As another example, if you have a "Contact Us" page, you usually need more than just a contact form/email address. The page should have enough information that the user knows what the contact form/email address is for, what happens when they contact you, what type of information you want the user to provide when contacting you, etc.</p>
