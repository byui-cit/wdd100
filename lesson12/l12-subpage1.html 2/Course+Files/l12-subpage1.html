<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>Last week, you created your own wireframes for your two child pages.&nbsp; You should have already used the text content for each child page in your wireframes and possibly the actual images.&nbsp; Here are a copy of the content and image pages here to use while creating your first sub-page (child page):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
For this assignment, choose one of the pages you identified in your site plan or as you&nbsp;changed your pages to last week and made wireframes for that you will complete as your first sub-page.&nbsp; &nbsp;A sub-page or child page is a page with links back and forth to your main page and to each other.
<div class="callout">
<p>Want a shortcut? We know that many of the elements from our home page&nbsp;must also be on your child pages...the entire header&nbsp;(logo, navigation, and banner) and the entire footer (info line and social media icons) .&nbsp; It is always good to let colors and fonts follow over as well, but as long as you stay within your color palette.</p>
<p>So use the <kbd>index.html</kbd> as a starting point.&nbsp; &nbsp;Make a new file in your editor and save it with a meaningful name one or two word title....(for example if I were making a contact page I would name my new file <kbd>contact.html</kbd>)...then copy and paste ALL&nbsp; of the code from your index.html into your new file.&nbsp; Make sure this page is in the folder with your index.html page and your media content.</p>
<p>Update the <kbd>&lt;title&gt; with the name of the page (contact where home was).</kbd></p>
</div>
<p>Before you delete the content that is specific to the home page (sec1, sec2 and sec3).... think if that same layout might work for what you are trying to do for the second page.&nbsp; The layout for the&nbsp; home page works well for a rivers page or a dates and rates page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reuse, all you have to do on that page is leave the section names and img id names the same, but make section 3 perhaps a second section 1..... then you just have to change the words and put a different image... all the css would be the same, so you wouln't have to change much there....Voila!&nbsp; Easy page... or if you want a different layout, leave the entire start of your page down to the&nbsp; bottom of your banner image.... and the entire footer and what is below it (the ending of the page... then remove the middle sections and add what you want.&nbsp; You still had a great start on your new page.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>You <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>do not</strong></em></span>&nbsp;create a new .css page for this new page. This could create a problem of having pages look different in important ways because the styles in one file were updated and not the other.</p>
<p>You should only have <strong>one</strong> .css file for your entire site.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to add any new styles for this new html page to the bottom of your existing .css.... put a few blank lines and then a comment&nbsp;after the last style rule is on in your .css code /*&nbsp; Page 2 below here */</p>
<p>or some words that will let you know what code is after that comment.&nbsp; This really helps when you need to find errors.</p>
</div>
<p>Super important*** If you decide to reuse the code for the second page (like mentioned above), do not change the names of the .html or especially the .css names or you will mess up the code for the home page.</p>
<p>You created your own wireframes for your two child pages.&nbsp; You should have already used the text content for each child page in your wireframes and possibly the actual images.&nbsp; Here are a copy of the content and image pages here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../Course%20Files/Subpage%20Content.html" target="_self">subpage content</a></li>
<li><a href="http://brothert.net/dryoar/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r9d1gq256pyuwws/AAD7bMbgW0keCVs5ZLUG3sBDa?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images 2</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Before turning your work in, look over your second page with an objective eye and check out to make sure that besides the obvious requirements: header, footer, at least one image, your code must be well formed, etc.&nbsp; that you also satisfy the two following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your work must have significant visual and textual content</li>
<li>Your work must be visually appealing</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<h4>What is meant by &ldquo;visually appealing?&rdquo;</h4>
<p>I wish there was a non-subjective way to measure this... but there isn't. Generally you only lose points for this with things that are obvious. For example, text that is difficult to read because it uses a color to similar to the background, a navigation bar that is directly against a banner or the text of the page rather than having some space around it, use of a color scheme that obviously indicates no thought was put into the color choices (this doesn't mean that you can't use white - it's more stating that if you just threw colors onto the page for the sake of throwing colors onto the page and it is obvious, you'll lose points), etc.</p>
<p>If you simply copy/pasted the text from the content page in most cases it will <strong>not</strong> be visually appealing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you <strong><em>format</em></strong>&nbsp;text to make it more readable!&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do not press return at the end of lines (let the text wrap naturally).&nbsp; It may make the text look neater at the end of lines for the moment, but s if the screen is resized, it will not&nbsp; large gaps between words.</li>
<li>Make sure that your text is large enough to be easily read when you back up just a little from your computer screen, but not so large that it looks overbearing.</li>
<li>Make sure the headlines stand out from the paragraphs.&nbsp; Headlines should usually fit on one line.</li>
<li>Never make the headline or paragraph line-height less than 1em... (that is single space) .&nbsp; If you do, and the screen size is reduced, text will wrap and will overlap instead of flow under the start of the line.</li>
<li>Be generous with &lt;p&gt; tags, padding, margins, and maybe even &lt;ul&gt;s.</li>
<li>You <strong>will</strong> lose points on this if you do not put some thought into the readability of the text.</li>
<li>Make your page balanced ... If you have something on the left, put something on the right.</li>
<li>Do not leave a lot of "white space" anywhere on the page so it looks like there is a hole on the page.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is considered &ldquo;significant content?&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Each page of a website should clearly convey to the user what the page is for. If it is a main/home page, it should provide the user with <strong><em>enough information</em></strong> to know what your site is about, whether it contains the information/products they are looking for, and, thereby, whether they should stick around and keep looking through your website.</p>
<ul>
<li>As another example, if you have a "Contact Us" page, you usually need more than just a contact form/email address/phone number. The page&nbsp;must have enough information that the user knows what the contact form/email address is for, what happens when they contact you, what type of information you want the user to provide when contacting you, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On a contact us page, you should have a paragraph or two thanking the user for coming to your site and another paragraph or two telling them you would like them to contact you for more info or with a reservation order for a trip.&nbsp; Remember, a contact us page is your last chance to hook the customer to either come back, or to book a trip.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also, part of the content, you must also have at least one image, yes even on a contact us page, that shows the reader why they should contact you.... you could also use icons for images... like icon of a phone, email, or payment icons like mastercard/visa images.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You are welcome to use the provided text, but feel free to say it "your way".&nbsp; The only page not covered with text content on the example page is a contact us page, you will have to come up with that on your own.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be creative with your text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Step 03</h3>
<p>Open your website&nbsp;into your browser to make sure the web page displays correctly and check the following:</p>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your nav links work from the home page to the new page, and from the new page back to the home page</li>
<li>Make sure you have at least one image (banner and logo do not count for this requirement since they are part of the header.</li>
<li>ay special attention to whether your images are all displaying&nbsp; properly</li>
<li>Make sure your socialmedia icon links work on the new page as they should and that they open into a new page.</li>
<li>Make sure that your text can be easily read, and that your colors go together well</li>
<li>Make sure your page has good visual appeal</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Once verified, submit the URL for your page to iLearn.&nbsp; Then remember to backup your&nbsp; files&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Go to the next page to access "W12.02 Sub-Page One Creation" and click "Upload". Make a note about which page you completed (so the instructor knows what to grade)</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>This activity will be graded using the following rubric (20pts):</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant textual content consisting of appropriate content for your audience so that they can understand the meaning and message of the page.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Working links to your main page and at least one of your other child pages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Be visually appealing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
