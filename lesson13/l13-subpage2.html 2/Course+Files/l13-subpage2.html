<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 60&nbsp;minutes</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>For this assignment, choose the other page you made a wireframe for that you will complete as your second sub-page.&nbsp; Follow the same steps you used for sub-page 1 last week making sure that you transfer a copy of the home page to the new page and then change the center part as desired leaving the top and header and footer intact.&nbsp; Make sure that you change the name in the title (the part that names the page) and the navigation links so that they work properly to the first page (you will have to fix the first sub page navigation for this page when you are done) so that ALL navigation links work properly on all of your pages.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of the content page and the image pages shared before:</p>
<ul>
<li>content page</li>
<li>images1</li>
<li>images 2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Open your website&nbsp;into your browser to make sure the web page displays correctly and the navigation works.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to whether your images are all displaying correctly, that you have your entire footer and entire header at the top and bottom of all 3 of your pages.&nbsp; Remember that in the title, each page will be listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to&nbsp;save&nbsp;&nbsp;your&nbsp;.html and .css files in brackets to save the changes.</p>
<p>To offer maximum time to work on your final project/report/Updated Site Plan, this child page will be not be turned in at this point.... it will be graded when you turn it in next week for&nbsp;your Final.</p>
