        <h1>WDD 130 Web Fundamentals</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to WDD 130, Web Fundamentals! This class serves as an introduction to Web design and development. The course
            is designed to introduce students to basics of Web technology, Web design and development principles. The course
            uses hands-on activities with students actually participating in simple Web design projects and programming.
            It is anticipated that students who complete this course will understand the fields of Web design and development
            and will have a good idea of whether or not they want to pursue Web design and development as a career.</p>
        <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
        <p>Remember, because this is a two-credit course, you will spend approximately 4-6 hours each week doing the homework.
            Do not plan otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself. Set aside time throughout the
            week to complete your assignments.</p>
