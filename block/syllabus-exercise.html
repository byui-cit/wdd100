            <h1>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to Web Design 100! This class serves as an introduction to Web design and development. The course is
                designed to introduce students to basics of Web technology, Web design and development principles. The course
                uses hands-on activities with students actually participating in simple Web design projects and programming.
                It is anticipated that students who complete this course will understand the fields of Web design and development
                and will have a good idea of whether or not they want to pursue Web design and development as a career.</p>
            <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
            <p>Remember, because this is a two-credit course, you will spend approximately 5-6 hours each week doing the homework.
                Do not plan otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself. Set aside time throughout
                the week to complete your assignments.</p>

            <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
            <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand what the World Wide Web is and some of its uses in business and society</li>
                <li>Develop simple Web pages</li>
                <li>Understand basic Web design principles</li>
                <li>Understand basic Web development principles</li>
                <li>Determine if Web design and development is a career they would like to pursue</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Homework</h2>
            <p>There will be 7 weeks with their associated assignments over the course of the semester. Most activities in the
                week are due by the due dates displayed on the Calendar. Late homework assignments will be accepted up to
                seven days late for a maximum of 50% credit. On those assignments where you are submitting a file or document
                make sure to include your name and section in the document.</p>
            <h2>ILearn</h2>
            <p>All of the activity instructions and assignments can be found in Ilearn. Make sure to spend some time learning
                how to make the most of Ilearn. Submitting assignments, checking your progress in the course and knowing
                how to see feedback from the instructor are all crucial things to know. Here are a couple of links you should
                check out if you are unsure about any of these things.</p>
