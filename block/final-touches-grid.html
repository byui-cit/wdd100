            </div>
            <p>We have made a lot of improvements to our page over the last few weeks. This week we finally take on the layout.
                After we finish the layout of our page it should look very similar to the wireframe, and will be close to
                complete.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Review again the
                    <a href="../images/wireframe-grid.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> for the Dry Oar site.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 01</h3>
            <p>First lets consider the banner. According to the wireframe it should extend all the way across the width of the
                page. Depending on which image you are using your's may or may not be doing that. Lets set a width of 100%
                on that image. Find the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that contains your banner image. You chould have added a class calling it something like <kbd>banner</kbd>. We can use that class to apply our width.</p>
                <div  class="callout">
                    <p>You might have tried something like:</p>
                    <pre><code class="css">.banner {
    width: 100%;
}
                    </code> </pre>
                    <p>to set the banner width. If you did you will find that it didn't work! Why not? Well...that would apply the width to the element with the class of banner. Guess what? As a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> it already had a width of 100%! What we need to do is apply the width to the image <em>inside</em> of the element with the class of banner. Does that make sense? We can do that by changing our selector slightly: </p>
                    <pre><code class="css">.banner img {
    width: 100%;
}
                    </code> </pre>
                </div>
                
            <h3>Step 02: Visualizing the Grid</h3>
            <p>Now lets tackle the main portion of the site. We will be using the CSS Grid you learned last week to accomplish this. The first step is to look at the <a href="../images/wireframe-grid-column-lines.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> and see if we can visualize how a grid (columns and rows) would fit around the elements on the page. Open it up, you may even want to print it out and draw some lines on it. </p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>In case your powers of visualization are a bit rusty...you can see my result below for the columns.</p>
                <section class="hint"><input type="checkbox" > <h4>Wireframe with Gridlines</h4><i></i><div>
                   <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                        <img alt="Wireframe with gridlines" src="../images/wireframe-grid-column-lines.png" title="Wireframe with gridlines" />
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Notice how I used 5 equal columns...and each element can be fit in one or more columns.
                    </p>
                </div></section>
                
                <p>And here is another image showing columns, rows, and gaps.</p>
                <section class="hint"><input type="checkbox" > <h4>Layout with Grid lines</h4><i></i><div>
                   <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                        <img alt="Wireframe with gridlines" src="../images/finished-layout-with-grid-lines.jpg" title="Wireframe with gridlines" />
                    </figure>
                </div>
                
                </div></section>
                <p>After you have a good idea of what the grid needs to look like (numbers and sizes of rows and columns), either by figuring it out on your own, or by review the two images above, continue on to the next step.</p>
                
            </div>
            <h3>Step 03: Defining the Grid</h3>
            <p>Let's try css grid to do this.
                <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">CSS Grid</a> is good when we have several elements that need to be placed into specific spots on a page.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>The instructions below are expecting a certain structure in your HTML to work. If you followed the instructions in the <a href="getting-started-p1.html" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> activity you should have it. It should look similar to the following:</p>
                   <pre><code class="html">
&lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div class="banner-box"&gt;
        &lt;img src="river-wide.JPG" alt="wide shot of the salmon river"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="home-grid"&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="home-headline-1"&gt;We run Rivers to relax.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="home-paragraph-1"&gt;We believe...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="home-right-img"&gt;
            &lt;img src="river-evening.jpg" alt="peaceful evening shot of a river"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="home-headline-2"&gt;We run Whitewater for the Rush.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="home-paragraph-2"&gt;That doesn't mean...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="home-left-img"&gt;
            &lt;img src="river-narrow.jpg" alt="river flowing through a canyon"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;section class="home-paragraph-3"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Come Run with us.&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We invite you...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
</code> </pre> 
               <p>Make any changes necessary to have yours match what is above. (HTML only...your images and text can be different)</p>
                </div>
            <p>Locate the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inside of <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> that contains most of our content. You should have given it a class earlier like <kbd>grid-main</kbd> (give it that class now if you didn't before). If you don't already have a rule in your CSS with that selecter add one now. Add the following property:
                <code>display: grid;</code>, to modify that section of your page to turn it into
                a grid container. In my case that rule would look like the following:</p>
            <pre><code class="css">
.grid-main {
    display: grid;
}    
</code> </pre>
            <p> Now all of the immediate children will become grid-items or children.</p>
            <p>Next we need to define our columns. Above you should have found that this layout works best with 5 equally sized columns. To define this in grid we use the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property. It is a property of the grid container, so we can add it to out <code>.grid-main</code> rule set. We don't know exactly how wide each column should be...only that they need to be equal. We can use the <kdb>fr</kdb> unit to do this. <kbd>1fr</kbd> = one equal portion of a space.</p>
            <pre><code class="css">
.grid-main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}    
</code> </pre>
           <p>If you remember the <code>repeat()</code> method from the Grid videos, you might try writing that rule like this instead:</p>
           <pre><code class="css">
.grid-main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
}    
</code> </pre>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>You should see an immediate change once you define your columns. The browser will try to start placing items into cells. It will do this even though we have not yet defined any rows!</p>
                  <h4>Explicit vs Implicit Grids</h4>
                  <p>Grids can be constructed either <em>explicitly</em>: you define everything about the grid, column number and widths, row numb and heights, and where every item should be placed, or <em>implicitly</em>: you let the browser make as many of the decisions as possible. Most grids are a mix of both. All grids need to have some columns defined, but after that the browsers will <em>implicitly</em> create rows as needed.</p>
                  <p>If you review the 'Layout with grid lines' image above you will see that the rows are not all the same height.  You may have been wondering how you are to know how big to make each row? I'll let you in on a little secret: you don't have to know in many cases. You can often let the browser figure it out!</p>
                  <p>My workflow when creating a new Grid layout is usually the following:</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Review my wireframe to begin visualizing the grid I need to make.</li>
                      <li>Define columns...and then see how close I am to achieving my desired layout!</li>
                      <li>Explicitly create rows <em>if needed</em></li>
                      <li>Explicitly place items <em>as needed</em></li>
                      <li>Adjust alignment <em>as needed</em></li>
                  </ol>
                <p>Let the browser do as much of the work as you can is my advice!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 04: Place the items</h3>
                <p>In our layout implicitly (automatically) created rows will be just fine.  But most of our items will have to be explicitly placed to get them into the right spots. Let's place the first together.</p>
            <p>Find the first headline.  It should have a class of <kbd>home-headline-1</kbd>, if it does not, add that class to it. Make a rule in your css for that class. Use the <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> properties to assign this item to a portion of the grid. If you review this <a href="../images/finished-layout-with-grid-lines.jpg" target="_blank">layout image</a> again you will see that the headline is in row 1, and only needs one row of space. It also starts in column 1, but needs 3 columns of space to fit. Your rule should look like this:</p>
                     <pre><code class="css">
.home-headline-1 {
    grid-column: 1 / span 3;
    grid-row: 1 / span 1;
}    
</code> </pre>
            <p>Continue placing the rest of the items into the correct rows/columns.</p>
              
            <div class="callout">
                <p>If your images are not resizing to fit in the box you have them in make sure you have the following rule
                    in your css: </p>
                <pre><code class="css">
img {
    max-width: 100%;
}      
        </code> </pre>
                <p>This will make sure that none of your images can ever be larger than the box they are in.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 05: Grid Gap</h3>
            <p>Looking good! One thing is bugging me though. The headlines and paragraphs are in some cases squished up against the images. If you refer back to the <a href="../images/finished-layout-with-grid-lines.jpg" target="_blank">layout image</a> again you will notice some space between the columns and rows. This is called a <kbd>gap</kbd> and can be added with the <code>grid-gap</code> property. This is a property that gets applied to the grid container. So add a grid gap or <kbd>1em</kbd> to your grid. </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Step 06: Navigation</h3>
            <p>We worked on the bottom (3rd) section a week or two ago to get it to center, and it should look pretty good by
                now. One thing though, it looks a bit squished. I think it would look better if it were closer in size to
                the other sections. Use margins, height, or padding to make it so.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Third section? you may ask...what happened to the second section? Well with mine since I used the same class
                    names for the different parts of my rows (leftcol, rightcol) the second section just took care of itself!
                    Anytime you have sections of your page that are styled or laid out similarly you should re-use your classes
                    to avoid having to do the same things over and over.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Step 07: Footer</h3>
            <p>The last thing to do now is to finish the footer. According to the wireframe the copyright should be on the left,
                the social media icons on the right, the whole footer should be 55px high, and there should be space around
                the icons. This is similar to what we have done before. You should be able to figure it out.</p>
            <p>Review the tips on last weeks positioning activity if you get stuck. (Hint: there are several ways to do this,
                you could use float, display:inline-block, or display: flex to do the major movement, then you will probably
                need to add some
                <kbd>padding, margin, or width</kbd> on the different elements in the footer to finish it off. If you use float
                remember that the floated element
                <strong>must</strong> come before the other stuff in the html.)</p>


            <h2>Navigation</h2>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>We've done a lot of work on our site over the last few weeks and it's looking pretty close to that wireframe
                    now. The final portion that needs our attention is the header. I have to admit I'll be really happy when
                    we get that fixed up!</p>
                <p>The code that I am basing this activity on looks like this: (you may want to adjust yours if it is not similar)</p>
                <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                        <img alt="Header-Code" src="../images/header-code.jpg" title="Header-Code" />
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>The top of my page looks like this:</p>
                <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                        <img alt="Example Header Code" width="50%" src="../images/header-start.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                            title="Example Header Code" />
                    </figure>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Step 08</h3>
            <p>Let's make our links flow across the page horizontally first. It's important to remind ourselves why they currently
                look the way they do...list items are block elements. So one way to make them flow horizontally would be to
                change them to inline-block elements instead...but we also saw above that Flexbox can make columns reflow
                as rows...and we also gain some nifty alignment tools. Lets use that to layout our navigation. Remember that
                for flexbox we need to identify the items we want to move around (in this case the
                <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>), then find their parent (in this case the
                <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) The parent is where we will put our
                <code>display:flex;</code> Write a CSS rule using a selector to only affect the list that is inside of a
                <kbd>nav</kbd> element and add that now.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>We learned about several new ways to
                    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank">select</a> elements with CSS this week in Khan Academy. One of them allows us to combine multiple selectors
                    together. For step 1 above we could use simple ul as our selector, but that would change all lists on
                    the page, and we may not want that. It would be better to get
                    <strong>only</strong> the lists that are inside of a nav. We can do that by using "
                    <kbd>nav ul</kbd>" as our selector instead of just
                    <kbd>ul</kbd>. Many of the steps of this activity will require similar selectors.</p>
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="Header-Step2" width="78%" src="../images/header-step2.jpg" title="Header-Step2" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Page after Step 1</p>
            <h3>Step 09</h3>
            <p>The links are moving in the right direction now...but they don't stand out very well. It would be good to increase
                the size of both the font, and the box that the links are in to make them stand out. Increase the size of
                the links by adding to a rule selecting your
                <kbd>nav</kbd>, and adjust the height as well.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>For my example site I wanted the navigation font to be a bit larger than normal...so I added
                    <kbd>font-size: 1.2em;</kbd> to my
                    <kbd>nav</kbd> rule.</p>
                <p>Increasing the height is a little trickier. If you add something like
                    <kbd>height: 3em;</kbd>, it will make the nav box 3X the size of the text...but it looks like this:</p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="Header step 2.2" width="78%" src="../images/header-step2.2.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                        title="Header step 2.2" />
                </p>
                <p>It increased the size of the box, but the font is top-aligned...not good. Luckily it is easy to fix. If we
                    use the
                    <kbd>line-height</kbd> property instead of
                    <kbd>height</kbd>, the text will automatically center itself vertically in the space.</p>
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="Header-Step 2.3" width="78%" src="../images/header-step2.3.jpg" title="Header-Step 2.3" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Page after Step 2</p>
            <h3>Step 10</h3>
            <p>The next thing we need to do is move the whole navigation bar up...so it is under the logo. While there are several
                ways to do this, the simplest would be to adjust the
                <kbd>margin-top</kbd>. Again this is affecting the whole navigation bar so we should apply that to the
                <kbd>nav</kbd> rule. You'll notice that as soon as we do this your Home link sits under the logo! Lets use
                <kbd>padding-left</kbd> to move it out.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>You may notice that there is a small gap between the navigation bar and the image below it. This is because
                    we placed our links in an unordered list and the default styling of lists is to have some margin on the
                    top and bottom to space it out from things around it. In this case we don't want it...if you see it you
                    can remove it by adding the following CSS:
                    <kbd>nav ul { margin: 0; }</kbd> (Read that selector as "Find any unordered lists which are inside of nav
                    elements and set their margin to 0)</p>
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="Header step 3" width="78%" src="../images/header-step3.jpg" title="Header step 3" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Page after Step 3</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>We are getting closer, but we still have some issues with that logo. The image I provided has what is known
                    as a transparent background...it lets colors underneath it show through. It's not working very well for
                    us now. Notice above that I placed the image inside of a div. We can change the background color of that
                    div to fix part of our issue.</p>
                <p>You might also notice that the logo is slightly underneath the banner image below it. One way we could get
                    that back on top would be to set
                    <kbd>position:relative</kbd>. This pulls the element slightly out of the flow and lets us control how things
                    layer.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 11</h3>
            <p>Make a new rule for the logo div (#logo) and set the background to white. Then add another line to that rule
                to change it's position to relative.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>As soon as you changed the position to relative of that logo div you are probably wondering what happened
                    to your nav bar. My page currently looks like this:</p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="Header Step 4" width="78%" src="../images/header-step4.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                        title="Header Step 4" />
                </p>
                <p>The div that we place the image in is a block element, and so it is taking the whole line up. We didn't notice
                    it before because it was below the navbar. But when we brought it to the top it caused problems. We need
                    to set a width on it to keep it from taking 100%</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 12</h3>
            <p>Get your navbar back by setting a width on the logo. (If you are using my logo 110px will work well.) Lets finish
                our logo off by adding a border to keep it from blending into the white background above it.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Our page is looking great! Only a couple of last tasks left. First is to address a usability issue. You should
                    never make a user guess about what elements are links and what aren't. We should give them plenty of
                    visual hints.</p>
                <p>One thing we can take advantage of is
                    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp" target="_blank">pseudo-classes</a>. Click on that link and look at the examples there...go on...I'll wait.</p>
                <p> Pseudo classes let us target specific states of elements, such as link. Links have 4 states: link (normal,
                    nothing has happened), visited (link has been clicked on), active (link is currently being clicked),
                    and hover (mouse is on link, but not clicking)</p>
                <p>The way we would change a link on hover is to add a rule like this:
                    <kbd>a:hover { color: green; }</kbd>. This would change the color of all links to green on hover.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 13</h3>
            <p>Lets set up some hover events to let our visitors know without a doubt that our navbar is indeed a navbar with
                clickable things. First lets increase the area of the link that will react to a hover, by default it is only
                the size of the words, I want a bigger box to hit. An easy way to do this is to add some padding to the links
                in our navbar (Hint: selector should be something like
                <kbd>nav a</kbd>). This will also have the affect of spreading out our links...they are currently a bit squished
                together. If you made your line-height 3em like I did above then I would try something like:
                <kbd>padding: 1em .6em</kbd>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="Header Step 5" width="78%" src="../images/header-step5.jpg" title="Header Step 5" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Page after Step 6</p>
            <h3>Step 14</h3>
            <p>Now lets add those hover events. Add another rule to your CSS that looks like
                <kbd>nav a:hover{ }</kbd>. This will only be active when the mouse is on the links in our navbar. Change something
                about your link in that rule.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>There are a couple of common things that can happen when you mouse over a link. You could do something very
                    simple and just add (or remove) an underline on hover (text-decoration: none). You could also change
                    the color of the link text, or change the color of link and background. For mine I think I will change
                    both foreground and background color...in fact I think I will swap them. Try a few different effects,
                    just remember the purpose: to make sure the visitor knows what are links and what aren't.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Notice!</h3>
                <p>Most of the time CSS doesn't care much about spaces. You can have them or not. Sometimes it does care though
                    and pseudo-classes are one of them.
                    <code>nav a:hover</code> will work just fine...
                    <code>nav a: hover</code> will not.Make sure to
                    <strong>not</strong> add spaces around the : on your pseudo-selector.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 15</h3>
            <p>Enter the view URL to your site into a browser to make sure the webpage displays correctly. Once verified, submit
                the URL for this assignment in ILearn. Remember that the URL should look like: http://projectname.glitch.com</p>
