            <hr />
            <h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
            <p>Estimated Time: 30 minutes</p>
            <p>Just like with HTML, CSS also has some important vocabulary that you should be familiar with as we move forward.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 01: Vocabulary list</h2>
            <p>Let's learn the CSS vocabulary you will need to succeed in this course.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>CSS has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is important that we become familiar with it.
                    Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a hard time making
                    sense of the instruction given in this course if you don't understand these terms.</p>

                <dl class="def-list">

                    <dt>
                        <strong>Selector</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>How you specify to the browser which HTML element(s) should be changed. We will focus primarily on 3
                        kinds of selectors in this class:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Element. If we wanted to modify all the paragraphs in</li>
                            <li>Class</li>
                            <li>ID</li>
                        </ol>
                        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;p&gt;A short paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green"&gt;A short paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paragraph3"&gt;A short paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                            </code></pre>

                        <pre><code class="css">p (element): Would select all p (paragraph) elements
.
                        </code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Property</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>Elements placed inside of other elements are called nested. Nested Elements are indented to make it easier
                        to see which elements are inside of others.
                        <pre><code class="html">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>

                    </dt>
                    <dd>In nesting the parent is the element that contains other elements.</dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Declaration</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>In nesting a child element is contained&nbsp;
                        <em>inside</em>&nbsp;of another element
                        <pre><code class="html">&lt;div&gt;  &lt;-- Parent --&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;-- Child --&gt;

                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Declaration Block</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed inside of the opening
                        tag. The value of the attribute should be wrapped in quotes. ie
                        <pre><code class="html">&lt;p title="A paragraph about where I am from" &gt;Idaho&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Rule</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>HTML tags are key words surrounded by angle brackets: ie&nbsp;
                        <pre><code class="html">&lt;body&gt;</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Units</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements = elements
                        with a meaning. Writing semantic HTML means using the html tag that best describes the content you
                        are adding to your page.</dd>

                <h3>Note!</h3>
                <p>Just like with the HTML, I do not expect you to memorize all of the properties, etc in these links at this
                    point. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the concepts and learn to recognize instances of the
                    terms above. The site that these link to is also a great resource for learning/reviewing HTML and CSS
                    concepts in general.</p>

            <h2>Step 03: Test yourself</h2>

                <a href="http://apps.workflower.fi/vocabs/css/en#unit" target="_blank">CSS Vocabulary</a> and see how many instances of the terms you learned above you can find. After looking
                on your own, select each term one at a time on the right and see if you found all the instances. This list
                has more vocabulary on it than I asked you to learn. Focus on the list above.

                        <li>Using your html editor, create a short auto-biography page using a few html tags that contains an

                            telling some facts and information about you. (150-250 words)</li>
                        <li>You also must add your image to your profile in iLearn (if it is not already there.).</li>
