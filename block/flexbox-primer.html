            <hr />
            <h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
            <p>Estimated Time: 30 minutes</p>
            <p>Just like with HTML, CSS also has some important vocabulary that you should be familiar with as we move forward.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 01: Vocabulary list</h2>
            <p>Let's learn the CSS vocabulary you will need to succeed in this course.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>CSS has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is important that we become familiar with it.
                    Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a hard time making
                    sense of the instruction given in this course if you don't understand these terms.</p>

                <dl class="def-list">

                    <dt>
                        <strong>Flex Parent (container)</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>How you specify to the browser which HTML element(s) should be changed. We will focus primarily on 3
                        kinds of selectors in this class:
                        <ol>
                            <li>element</li>
                            <li>.class</li>
                            <li>#id</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For example, if we have the following HTML:</p>
                        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;p&gt;No class or id on this paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green"&gt;This paragraph has a class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green" id="paragraph3"&gt;This paragraph has a class and an id &lt;/p&gt;
                            </code></pre>
                        <p>We could select all of the paragraphs by using the element selector:
                            <code>p</code> (Notice that there is no preface...we simply use the tag name)
                        </p>
                        <p>We could select just the second and third paragraphs by using the class attribute on them as a selector
                            like this:
                            <code>.green</code> (Notice that we preface the class name with a period)
                        </p>
                        <p>...and we could select just the last paragraph by using its ID as a selector like this:
                            <code>#paragraph3</code> (Notice that we preface the ID with a hashtag)
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="css">p /* element selector: all paragraphs */
.green /* class selector: all paragraphs with an attribute class="green" */
#paragraph3 /* id selector: the paragraph with the attribute id="paragraph3" */
                        </code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Flex Child (item)</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>What we want to change about the element(s) selected by our selector. ie
                        <pre><code class="css">background-color</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Main Axis</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>How we want to change a property
                        <pre><code class="css">green</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Counter Axis</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>A combination of a property and value with a colon. Declarations must end with a semi-colon (;)
                        <pre><code class="css">background-color: green;</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Declaration Block</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>One or more declarations will be combined into a block using curly braces: {}
                        <pre><code class="css">{
    background-color: green;
    margin: 5px;    
}</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Rule (or Rule-set)</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>A rule is the combination of a selector and declaration block. The example below would select all elements
                        with a class="green" and turn their background green!
                        <pre><code class="css">.green {
    background-color: green;
    margin: 5px;    
}</code></pre>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>Units</strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>Many properties require a value with units. Some units are absolute meaning that they are always the
                        same size. Other units are relative meaning that their size changes based on something else (like
                        the size of the text or the width or the browser or an element). Common CSS units are: px (absolute),
                        em (relative, based off of font size), and % (relative, based off of width) </dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>Note!</h3>
                <p>Just like with the HTML, I do not expect you to memorize all of the properties, etc in these links at this
                    point. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the concepts and learn to recognize instances of the
                    terms above. The site that these link to is also a great resource for learning/reviewing HTML and CSS
                    concepts in general.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Step 03: Test yourself</h2>
            <p>Visit this site:
                <a href="http://apps.workflower.fi/vocabs/css/en#unit" target="_blank">CSS Vocabulary</a> and see how many instances of the terms you learned above you can find. After looking
                on your own, select each term from our list one at a time on the right and see if you found all the instances.
                This list has more vocabulary on it than I asked you to learn. Don't let this overwhelm or distract you.
                Focus on the list above.
