            <h1>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to Web Design 100! This class serves as an introduction to Web design and development. The course is
                designed to introduce students to basics of Web technology, Web design and development principles. The course
                uses hands-on activities with students actually participating in simple Web design projects and programming.
                It is anticipated that students who complete this course will understand the fields of Web design and development
                and will have a good idea of whether or not they want to pursue Web design and development as a career.</p>
            <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
            <p>Remember, because this is a one-credit block course, you will spend approximately 4-6 hours each week doing the
                homework. Do not plan otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself. Set aside time
                throughout the week to complete your assignments.</p>
            <h2>Text</h2>
            <p>
                <em>There is no textbook for this course. </em>However, because many of the readings and assignments are online,
                students are recommended to have a steady internet connection.</p>
            <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
            <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand what the World Wide Web is and some of its uses in business and society</li>
                <li>Develop simple Web pages</li>
                <li>Understand basic Web design principles</li>
                <li>Understand basic Web development principles</li>
                <li>Determine if Web design and development is a career they would like to pursue</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Caution/Schedule</h2>
            <p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be given notification of any changes; check
                I-Learn and email frequently. You should check the course schedule each day to determine when things are
                due.
            </p>
            <h2>Homework</h2>
            <p>There will be&nbsp;7 weeks with their associated assignments over the course of the block. Most activities in
                the week and each initial discussion board post is due by the due dates displayed on the Calendar.&nbsp;There
                are three important dates associated to each activity or assignment:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The start date: The date the activity begins</li>
                <li>The due date: The date the activity is due.</li>
                <li>The end date: The date the activity locks and no submission will be allowed after that.</li>
            </ul>
            *Please note:&nbsp; Activities are not accepted via email.&nbsp; You must submit your activities in the correct place and
            within the posted timeframe.
            <!-- <h2>Quizzes and Essays</h2>
            <p>There will be 2 reading quizzes and 2 essays. Late quizzes and essays will be accepted up to seven days late for a maximum of 50% credit.</p> -->
            <h2>ILearn</h2>
            <p>All of the activity instructions and assignments can be found in Ilearn. Make sure to spend some time learning
                how to make the most of Ilearn. Submitting assignments, checking your progress in the course and knowing
                how to see feedback from the instructor are all crucial things to know. Here are a couple of links you should
                check out if you are unsure about any of these things.</p>

            <p>There is one major class project for this course and it consists of
                <strong>two primary requirements</strong>. The first is the design and development of a complete 3 page web site.
