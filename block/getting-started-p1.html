                    <kbd>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</kbd>. Meta tags give the browser information to help it build the web page.
                    They are always found in the&nbsp;
                    <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;with the other information that is for the browser only. Look to make sure that

                </h3>
                <p>Let's go ahead and change the title next. The &lt;title&gt; of the page shows at the top of the browser window
                    or on the tab of a browser window, and in the search listing for a site. Let's pick something that will
                    make sure people know what the site is, and what page they are currently on. Something like "Whitewater
                    Rafting Vacations - Dry Oar Boating - Home".</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>We know from the&nbsp;
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-boxes-labels.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;for the home page for the Dry Oar site that there will be a combination of images,
                        headlines, and text on the page. The Khan academy lesson for this week taught you how to add all
                        of those things to a page with HTML. You will need to refer back to your wireframe and site plan
                        document throughout this activity to make sure you don't forget anything on the home page.</p>
                    <p>As you look at the wireframe you will notice a few things. First a box with an X through it indicates
                        an image will go there. A shaded box around something indicates that it should be colored. The numbers
                        that are in the corners of some of the boxes indicate sizes. </p>
                    <p>The wireframe also indicates where our headlines and paragraphs will be, and should show approximately
                        how much space the text should take up, and the relative sizes of the headlines and paragraph text.
                        It also helps us to see the organization of the page. Elements are organized into groups. It will
                        be important that we include html markup to represent those groups, as well as to get the content
                        on the page.</p>

                    <span class="highlight">Step 04</span>: Using semantic elements
                </h3>
                <p>Building a website is actually a lot like building a house. You start with a blueprint (wireframe) and then
                    you build the foundation and frame for the house. We have already built the foundation. We did that when
                    we added the
                    <kbd>&lt;html&gt;</kbd>,
                    <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>, and
                    <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> elements above. The framing takes the rooms outlined on the blueprint and creates
                    a real space to put them. We need to do the same thing for our webpage, except for instead of rooms we
                    are looking at content areas. </p>
                <p>The way we "frame" in our webpage is by looking carefully at our wireframe to see what "rooms" we have. Then
                    we use some special HTML tags to define them.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>Take a moment to review the
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-boxes-labels.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a> again to help remember what we are trying to do. Remember that I mentioned above that
                        we are looking right now at content areas...elements on the page that are related and grouped. The
                        wireframe has colored boxes to help you to see those relationships. We need to add some markup to
                        create those 'rows' or 'boxes' in our html.</p>
                    <p>Html has several tags specifically for this purpose. Some have specific semantic meanings and others
                        don't. We should always try and use the ones with meaning whenever we can. Here is a list of some
                        of the more common of these tags:&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;header&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;footer&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;main&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;article&gt;</kbd>,
                        <kbd>&lt;figure&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;aside&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>, and&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd>.</p>
                    <p>Last week you were asked to review a short article on
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Semantics</a>. There is a chart there that does a nice job of showing how those elements might
                        be used in a simple site layout. Take a minute to go check it out again.

                    </p>
                    <p>All of these elements behave the same in the browser except for&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd>, but they are used to show different sections of the page. Try to use the more
                        specific ones first, using a generic&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;only if none of the others seems to apply to the content you are boxing in.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Add HTML elements to your body to start outlining content areas. The first we need is at the top of the page.
                    Notice that there is a box around the logo and navigation bar. Those elements are related and form the
                    header of the page. Lucky for us if you look in the list of tags above you will see that there is a
                    <kbd>&lt;header&gt;</kbd> tag! Not only that but the starter code already has one.</p>
                <p>Inside of the header you can see a second box around the links for the navigation. Again after reviewing
                    the list above we see a
                    <kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd> tag...perfect! And again it looks like the instructor was a little too generous with
                    the starter code because you already have one!</p>
                <p>Next let's add an area where the main content for this page will go. On a normal site the header and footer
                    will stay the same across pages...but the central content will change from page to page. We need a box
                    to hold that. The
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag was built for just this use. Add a
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element to your page right below the
                    <code>&lt;/header&gt;</code> </p>
                <p>The first thing we need inside our new
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is a banner image that will stretch all the way across the screen. Let's add some html to hold
                    that. In this case a simple
                    <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> is probably the right answer.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <h4>Tip!</h4>
                    <p>There will be a lot of code examples in this and other lessons. Avoid the temptation to just copy/paste
                        them into your page. Type them out! This might seem like a bother, but you will remember the HTML
                        and CSS we use much better if you do ;)</p>
                </div>
                <p>At this point my
                    <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="html">
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- logo will go here --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt; 
            &lt;!-- navigation here --&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- banner image will go here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

</code></pre>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>You may have noticed the lines in my code above that are in grey. They are called comments...notes to
                        yourself that the browser will ignore. Comments start with &lt;!-- and end with --&gt; and everything
                        in-between will be ignored. Comments are a great way to remind yourself what you were thinking when
                        you did something in your page. </p>
                </div>
                <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 05</span>: Outlining 'Rows' and 'Columns' with HTML
                </h3>
                <p>Let's move onto the next section. (Labeled 'Row 1' on the wireframe) It has 3 boxes. One that essentially
                    forms the "row", and then 2 others inside of that section that will form "columns". All of these 'rows'
                    should go into the
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element. Notice that one of those columns contains a headline and paragraph. If you did any reading
                    on the tags above you might have noticed the
                    <code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_section.asp" target="_blank">&lt;section&gt;</a></code> tag. It is specifically for a section of a page that contains a headline, one or more paragraphs, and
                    possibly an image. Let's add one. </p>
                <p>After adding the
                    <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd> element we need to add 2 more elements to represent the left and right columns.
                    In this case again I think a
                    <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> would be great.</p>
                <p>Your
                    <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> should look something like this now:</p>

                    <h4>Indentation</h4>
                    <p>You may have noticed something else about my code as well. Notice how I am indenting my HTML elements
                        to help me clearly see which elements are inside of other elements. As your page gets larger this
                        becomes more and more important. Take a little time to keep your code in order...you will be happy
                        you did later on.</p>

                <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 06</span>: More 'Rows'
                </h3>
                <p>We have 2 more rows now in the wireframe to define. The Second row of content is actually structured exactly
                    the same as the previous one. So add another
                    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> that looks just like the first (include the divs inside the section as well), right
                    <em>after</em> the first section. The third row is more simple. We can probably get away with a single
                    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> for it. Make sure both of these
                    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s go
                    <em>inside</em> of
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>. It should look something like this, BUT below is only an example of the relationship of the section
                    elements...it is not complete...
                    <strong>don't just copy/paste this code!</strong> (you should have
                    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s inside sections one and two as shown above!)</p>

                <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 07</span>: footer
                </h3>
                <p>We are now to the bottom of the page. This is usually known as the footer. Lucky for us there is a
                    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag. Add one below your 3rd row (section) and after the
                    <code>&lt;/main&gt;</code>. Inside of that I didn't draw any boxes, but hopefully by now you can recognize that there are 2 content
                    areas inside our footer. One for the Copyright and another for some social media icons we will add later.</p>
                <p>Add 2 elements to contain those bits of content. Remember: the
                    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> should go
                    <em>below</em> the
                    <code>&lt;/main&gt;</code>

                    <p>Great job making it this far! If you preview your page however, you might be surprised to find that your
                        page looks exactly the same as it did when you started! How is this possible? This is actually normal.
                        All of the work we have done so far was to lay the foundation of our page. This structure will make
                        it easier for us later to layout the page and get everything placed where we want it to be. This
                        early work will pay off later as we work towards finishing the page.</p>
                    <p>Continue on to
                        <a href="getting-started-p2.html">Part two</a> to add content to your page. This is when we will start seeing changes. :)</p>
