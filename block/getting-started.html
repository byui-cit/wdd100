<h2>Activity Directions</h2>
<p><span class="highlight">Estimated Time</span>:&nbsp;1:30 minutes</p>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 01</span></h3>
<p>If you completed the Software setup activity you should already have an html file ready called index.html. It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">
&lt;!-- HTML - File Name: "index.html" --&gt;
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;My first website&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>If you don't have that, go follow the <a href="../lesson01/software-setup-github.html" target="_blank">Software Setup</a> instructions and come back when you are done.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h3>Naming files for the web</h3>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind as you come up with names for the files and folders that will make up your website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always name the first page of your site&nbsp;<kbd>index.html</kbd></li>
    <li>Most web hosts are&nbsp;<i>case-sensitive</i>&nbsp;which means there is a difference between&nbsp;<kbd><span class="highlight">I</span>ndex.html</kbd>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<kbd>index.html</kbd></li>
<li>So...Make your filenames all lowercase to avoid problems with case sensitivity.</li>
<li>Avoid spaces and other special characters in your filenames (a-z, 0-9, -, and _ are all safe to use)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 02</span></h3>
<p>From the Khan Academy lesson we learned about&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</kbd>. Meta tags give the browser information to help it build the web page. They are always found in the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;with the other information that is for the browser only. Launch your editor on your computer and make sure the index.html file is opened and then lets add that meta line to our page...right above the title.</p>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 03</span></h3>
<p>Let's go ahead and change that title right now as well. The &lt;title&gt; of the page shows at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser window, and in the search listing for a site. Lets pick something that will make sure people know what the site is, and what page they are currently on. Something like "Whitewater Rafting Vacations | Dry Oar Boating | Home".</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>We know from the&nbsp;<a href="../images/wireframe-new.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;for the home page for the Dry Oar site that there will be a combination of images, headlines, and text on the page. The Khan academy lesson for this week taught you how to add all of those things to a page with HTML. You will need to refer back to your wireframe and site plan document throughout this activity to make sure you don't forget anything on the home page.</p>
    <p>As you look at the wireframe you will notice a few things.  First a box with an X through it indicates an image will go there. A shaded box around something indicates that it should be colored. The numbers that are in the corners of some of the boxes indicate sizes. </p>
    <p>The Wireframe also indicates where out headlines and paragraphs will be, and should show approximately how much space the text should take up, and the relative sizes of the headlines and paragraph text. It also helps us to see the organization of the page.  Elements are organized into groups.  It will be important that we include html markup to represent those groups, as well as to get the content on the page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Note!</strong>: We will not be adding colors and other styles this week.  Our only goal is to get all of the content onto the page that is shown on the wireframe.  Our Page will <strong>not</strong> look like the wireframe when we finish this week. Each week will get us closer, but our page will not look exactly like the wireframe until Week 10, so patience will be required :)</p>
    </div>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 04</span></h3>
<p>Let's work on the top section first. I have provided a page with&nbsp;<a href="http://brothert.net/dryoar/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank">some images</a>&nbsp;on it that you can use for this assignment (or you can find some of your own). Pull that site up and find the logo image. Add the an&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;tag to your page inside the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd>. You can replace the "Hello World" we put there. Remember that the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;tag has 2 required attributes.&nbsp;<kbd>alt</kbd>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<kbd>src</kbd>.</p>
<p><kbd>src</kbd> should indicate the location of the image and <kbd>alt=""</kbd>&nbsp;should contain a short description about the image and is used primarily for the screen readers that the visually impaired use to browse the web.</p>
<p class="callout">This image is already the right size and is on a web server, so we just need to figure out what it's URL is to add it to our page. Your browser makes it really easy to do that. If you click with the right mouse button on any image in the browser your computer will offer you several actions you can take. The one we are interested in right now is "Copy Image Address".</p>
<p>Copy the address for the logo image and paste the result into the src attribute in our image. the final tag should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;img src="http://brothert.net/dryoar/images/dryoarlogo.png" alt="Dry Oar boating logo"&gt;</code></pre>
<div class="callout">
    <p>You may be wondering what your site looks like.  One of the features of Brackets is an easy way to preview our work in the Chrome browser.  If you have Chrome installed you can click on the lightening bolt icon in the top right corner of the editor window.  Once you open that any changes you make in Brackets will automatically show up in the browser.</p>
</div>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 05</span></h3>
<p>Now it's time to add the list of subpages that will eventually become links and provide our site's navigation.</p>
<p class="callout">Notice that I said 'list' there. One thing most people don't realize is that most navigation bars on most websites are made with an unordered list...the same one you learned how to use in this week's Khan Academy lesson. They are well disguised, but they really are lists.</p>
<p>Take the list of pages from the wireframe and create an unordered list&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;ul&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;with each page becoming it's own list item&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;li&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;right below the logo that we added.</p>


    <div class="callout">
       <p>Take a moment to review the <a href="../images/wireframe-new.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a> again to help remember what we are trying to do. Remember that I mentioned above that there are several elements on the page that are related and grouped. The wireframe has red boxes to help you to see some of those relationships...essentially the rows that makup the layout. We need to add some markup to create those 'rows' or 'boxes' around those same elements in our html.</p>
        <p>Html has several tags specifically for this purpose. Some have specific semantic meanings and others don't. We should always try and use the ones with meaning whenever we can. Here is a list of some of the more common of these tags:&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;header&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;footer&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;main&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;article&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;figure&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;aside&gt;</kbd>,&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>, and&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd></p>
        <p>All of them behave the same in the browser except for&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd>, but they are used to show different sections of the page. Try to use the more specific ones first, using a generic&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;only if none of the others seems to apply to the content you are boxing in.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Lets add the first of our grouping or organizational html tags.  Notice that there is a red box around the navigation.  Looking over the list of semantic tags above is there one that fits? <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> looks perfect! Wrap your unordered list in <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags. Your html should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;nav&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
       ...the rest of your list...
   &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code> </pre>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 06</span></h3>
<img class="right"  src="../images/2015-11-11_1525.png" alt="Tiny Partial Circle" title="Tiny Partial Circle" />
<p>Next is a wide banner image. Look through the images provided and choose one to add to your page. Remember you can see what your site is looking like anytime by hitting the view at the top of the page.</p>
<p class="clearfix">If your page does not update, click the refresh button (The tiny partial circle by the address line) &nbsp;on the Chrome&nbsp;browser.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 07</span></h3>
   <div class="callout">
   <p>Next we have 2 sections that have a headline, a paragraph, and an image (Make sure to refer&nbsp;to&nbsp;the wireframe). Notice how they form the 'rows' in the layout.  Looks like another good place for some structural html.  In this case a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> would not be appropriate, but if you read the description of <code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_section.asp" target="_blank">&lt;section&gt;</a></code> you will find that it should be used to define a section of the document that contains a headline, one or more paragraphs, and possibly an image. That is exactly what each of these rows is made up of.</p>
   </div>
    
    <p>Add a <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd> block to your html after the large banner added in the last step. Using the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd>or&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;h2&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;tag add the first headline to the page inside of the <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd> (There is a headline on the wireframe you can use...or you can make up your own). Then use a&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;tag to add the following text: (or something similar...feel free to edit this :) )</p>
<kbd>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</kbd></div>


<p>Finally choose another picture from those provided and add it after the paragraph.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how your new section should look:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;We run Rivers to relax.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing...  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src="picture1.jpg" alt="picture of a river"&gt;    
&lt;/section&gt;
        </code>
        </pre>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 08</span></h3>
<p>The next section is very similar...notice that the order of the elements is slightly different. Make sure to start with another <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd> tag. This time though you will add image, then headline, and then paragraph (the order <em>is</em> important). Here is the text for this section:</p>
<kbd>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</kbd>

<h3><span class="highlight">Step 09</span></h3>
<p>The next section shouldn't be a problem at this point. Add one more <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd> that will contain the headline and another paragraph. Here is the text:</p>
<kbd>We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing rivers we visit. Check out our trips and let us know which one best suits you. We're waiting to hear from you!</kbd>
<h3><span class="highlight">Step 10</span></h3>
<p>Finally lets add a <kbd>&lt;footer&gt;</kbd>to contain that copyright. You can just put it into another paragraph. To make the copyright symbol we use a special code, there are many of these but we will just learn this one today: &amp;copy; Place that right before the 2015 so it will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 2015 Dry Oar&lt;p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Lets go ahead and add your name as part of the footer as well. So the final html for the footer section should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;footer&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 2015 Dry Oar || FirstName LastName &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to use the current year for the copyright! We will add the icons for the social media links later.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<div class="callout">
    <p>Whew!  We got all the content in....but you might of noticed it doesn't look too great. Remember that HTML is responsible to get content on a page, but to style it we use CSS.  Make sure you have completed the Adding Some Style Khan Academy lesson before continuing.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="highlight">Step 11</span></h3>
            <p>Let's add some styles! In the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;portion of our page let's add a&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;element.</p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 12</span></h3>
    <p>The wireframe has a rectangle around the navigation menu. This usually indicates a colored box in that area. Let's add some color to our&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>. In the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;style&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;block we added let's make a CSS rule modifying our&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd></p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Every CSS rule is made up of 3 elements. First we always need a selector, in this case we want to modify any&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;elements on our page so our selector will be:&nbsp;<kbd>nav</kbd>. Next there are always curly braces { }. Inside those braces we place one or more pairs of 'property to change: value to change it to'</p>
                <p>So in this example to change the background color of our&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;after adding the new rule our style block would look like this: (you should use one of your selected colors, probably not salmon)</p>
                <pre>        <code class="html">
&lt;style&gt;
     nav {
         background-color: salmon;
     }    
&lt;/style&gt;
        </code>
        </pre>
                <p>It's worth taking a moment and talking about what valid options you have to designate color. The 3 main ways are hexadecimal, rgb, and predefined color names. Take a moment to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools: CSS colors</a>&nbsp;to get a brief outline about the differences. Also take a look at this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" target="_blank">list of color names</a>&nbsp;that your browser will understand.</p>
            </div>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 13</span></h3>
<p>The color you changed the background of the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;to may have made your text hard to read. In the site plan you should have chosen a color for your links. Add another line to your css rule to change the&nbsp;<kbd>color</kbd>&nbsp;for the text in the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;as well. Again you should use a color from your chosen palette. Pick something that looks good with the background color and that is easily readable.</p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 14</span></h3>
<p>Our next step is to add the background color to the second&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;in our page.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>We have a slight problem here though. If we use the tag as a selector like we did with&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;it will change both of our sections, which we don't want. From the Khan Academy lesson you should have learned about 2 other selectors: id selectors and class selectors. Id selectors should be used for elements that have unique styling needs, class selectors for those elements that might share styles with other elements. (I tend to use far more class selectors than id, I like re-using CSS rules)</p>
            </div>
<p>In this case let's use an ID. Add an&nbsp;<kbd>id=""</kbd>&nbsp;to the second section so we can apply some styles just to that one. Pick a descriptive name for the id, then add a rule to change the background color of that box to one of your colors. (Remember that when you write the rule you need to add a '#' to your id name so the browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;and not the&nbsp;<em>tag</em>)</p>
           <p>Your section should look something like this (you can call your id anything you want...I chose "top-row")</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;section id="top-row"&gt; ...content of section here... &lt;/section&gt;
</code> </pre>
           <p>The corresponding css to style that id would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css">#top-row {
   ...css here...
}
</code> </pre>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 15</span></h3>
<p>Next let's make our headlines stand out a little more. Lets change the color of all headlines again to one of the colors in your palette. Since we need to make sure everything from&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;h6&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;gets the same styling we will take advantage of the fact that you can apply the same styles to more than one selector, so we can write one rule instead of six to change them all.</p>
<p>To have a set of rules apply to more than one selector we separate them with a comma. So the rule to change the color of all headlines would look something like this:</p>
            <h2>Multiple selector Example</h2>
            <pre>        <code class="css">
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
     color: #6495ED;
}    
        </code>
        </pre>
            <h3><span class="highlight">Step 16</span></h3>
            <p>Changing the color of the second section may have made the text there hard to read. For our final step lets use a class selector to change the color of that text. Add a&nbsp;<kbd>class=""</kbd>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;inside the second section. Choose a descriptive name for the class, then create a css rule to change the color. Remember that you need to precede your rule with a '.' so that the browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;<em>class</em>&nbsp;and not a&nbsp;<em>tag</em>. If done correctly it should only change the text of the paragraph we applied the class to.</p>


<h3><span class="highlight">Step 17</span></h3>
    <p>Commit your changes using the Github Desktop application, then sync. That will make your changes available to view from any computer through the web. While working in Brackets the changes you make can <strong>only</strong> be seen on your computer.  View your web page online to make sure your changes are correct. Once verified, submit the URL from your browser that you use to view your page to iLearn.</p>
<div class="callout">
    <p>Remember that the URL you should turn in for your site will look something like this (you would replace 'thompsonda' with whatever your Github username is):</p>
    <pre><code class="html">http://thompsonda.github.io</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Always</strong> check that URL <strong>before</strong> you submit your assignments in Ilearn to make sure that all your changes show.</p>
</div>
