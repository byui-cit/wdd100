                    <p>There are a few things to keep in mind as you come up with names for the files and folders that will
                        make up your website.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always name the first page of your site&nbsp;

                        <li>Most web hosts are&nbsp;
                            <i>case-sensitive</i>&nbsp;which means there is a difference between&nbsp;

                </h3>
                <p>From the Khan Academy lesson we learned about&nbsp;
                    <kbd>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</kbd>. Meta tags give the browser information to help it build the web page.
                    They are always found in the&nbsp;
                    <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;with the other information that is for the browser only. Look to make sure that
                    this line is in the starter code you were given.</p>

                    <span class="highlight">Step 03: Change the title</span>
                </h3>
                <p>Let's go ahead and change the title next. The &lt;title&gt; of the page shows at the top of the browser window
                    or on the tab of a browser window, and in the search listing for a site. Let's pick something that will
                    make sure people know what the site is, and what page they are currently on. Something like "Whitewater
                    Rafting Vacations | Dry Oar Boating | Home".</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>We know from the&nbsp;
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-boxes-labels.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;for the home page for the Dry Oar site that there will be a combination of images,
                        headlines, and text on the page. The Khan academy lesson for this week taught you how to add all
                        of those things to a page with HTML. You will need to refer back to your wireframe and site plan
                        document throughout this activity to make sure you don't forget anything on the home page.</p>
                    <p>As you look at the wireframe you will notice a few things. First a box with an X through it indicates
                        an image will go there. A shaded box around something indicates that it should be colored. The numbers
                        that are in the corners of some of the boxes indicate sizes. </p>
                    <p>The wireframe also indicates where our headlines and paragraphs will be, and should show approximately
                        how much space the text should take up, and the relative sizes of the headlines and paragraph text.
                        It also helps us to see the organization of the page. Elements are organized into groups. It will
                        be important that we include html markup to represent those groups, as well as to get the content
                        on the page.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Note!</h3>
                    <p>We will
                        <strong>NOT</strong> be adding colors and other styles this week. Our only goal is to get all of the content
                        onto the page that is shown on the wireframe. Our Page will
                        <strong>NOT</strong> look like the wireframe when we finish this week. Each week will get us closer, but
                        our page will not look exactly like the wireframe for several weeks, so patience will be required
                        :)

                    <span class="highlight">Step 04: "Framing" with semantic elements</span>
                </h3>
                <p>Building a website is actually a lot like building a house. You start with a blueprint (wireframe) and then
                    you build the foundation and frame for the house. We have already built the foundation. We did that when
                    we added the
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements above. The framing takes the rooms outlined on the blueprint and creates
                    a real space to put them. We need to do the same thing for our webpage, except for instead of rooms we
                    are looking at content areas. </p>
                <p>The way we "frame" in our webpage is by looking carefully at our wireframe to see what "rooms" we have. Then
                    we use some special HTML tags to define them.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>Take a moment to review the
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-grid-boxes.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> again to help remember what we are trying to do. Remember that I mentioned above that
                        we are looking right now at content areas...elements on the page that are related and grouped. The
                        wireframe has colored boxes to help you to see those relationships. We need to add some markup to
                        create those containers in our html.</p>
                    <p>Html has several tags specifically for this purpose. Some have specific semantic meanings and others
                        don't. We should always try and use the ones with meaning whenever we can. Here is a list of some
                        of the more common of these tags:&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
                        <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p>Last week you were asked to review a short article on
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Semantics</a>. There is a chart there that does a nice job of showing how those elements might
                        be used in a simple site layout. Take a minute to go check it out again.

                    </p>
                    <p>All of these elements behave the same in the browser except for&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, but they are used to show different sections of the page. Try to use the more
                        specific ones first, using a generic&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;only if none of the others seems to apply to the content you are boxing in.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Add HTML elements to your body to start outlining content areas. The first we need is at the top of the page.
                    Notice that there is a box around the logo and navigation bar. Those elements are related and form the
                    header of the page. Lucky for us if you look in the list of tags above you will see that there is a
                    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag! Not only that but the starter code already has one.</p>
                <p>Inside of the header you can see a second box around the links for the navigation. Again after reviewing
                    the list above we see a
                    <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag...perfect! And again it looks like the instructor was a little too generous with
                    the starter code because you already have one!</p>
                <p>Next let's add an area where the main content for this page will go. On a normal site the header and footer
                    will stay the same across pages...but the central content will change from page to page. We need a box
                    to hold that. The
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag was built for just this use. Add a
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element to your page right below the
                    <code>&lt;/header&gt;</code> </p>
                <p>The first thing we need inside our new
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is a banner image that will stretch all the way across the screen. Let's add some html to hold
                    that. In this case a simple
                    <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> is probably the right answer.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <h4>Tip!</h4>
                    <p>There will be a lot of code examples in this and other lessons. Avoid the temptation to just copy/paste
                        them into your page. Type them out! This might seem like a bother, but you will remember the HTML
                        and CSS we use much better if you do ;)</p>
                </div>
                <p>Below that banner is a bunch of content. It is seprate from the banner, but related. Let's use an HTML element to group the content in that section together. Another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> would work well again.</p>
                <p>Notice that the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s we created for the banner and the rest of the main content look just the same! We need a way to distinguish between the two elements. The common way to do this in HTML is with a <kbd>class</kbd> or <kbd>id</kbd> attributes. Lets add unique classes to each of those divs that describe what will be inside them. For example for the banner lets add <kbd>class="banner-box"</kbd> and for the rest of the content add <kbd>class="home-grid"</kbd> (this name will make more sense later). </p>
                <p>Finally we need one more container on our page. This one will hold the footer information. Again if you refer to the list of semantic elements above you will see a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element.  Add one below <code>&lt;/main&gt;</code>.</p>
                
                <p>At this point my
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="html">
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;div class="logo-box"&gt;&lt;!-- logo will go here --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt; 
            &lt;!-- navigation here --&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;div class="banner-box"&gt; &lt;!-- banner image will go here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="home-grid"&gt; &lt;!-- the rest of the main content will go here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt; &lt;!-- footer info here --&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

</code></pre>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>You may have noticed the lines in my code above that are in grey. They are called comments...notes to
                        yourself that the browser will ignore. Comments start with &lt;!-- and end with --&gt; and everything
                        in-between will be ignored. Comments are a great way to remind yourself what you were thinking when
                        you did something in your page. </p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>With that we should now have all of the "framing" done on our webpage. We have a place defined now for
                        all the content that needs to be on the page. With that done we are now ready to actually add it!
                        Remember to refer often to the
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-boxes-labels.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a> as you are adding the content. The instructions will make much more sense if you are
                        looking at the blueprint!</p>
                </div>
                <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 05: Header content</span>
                </h3>
                <p>Let's work on the header first. Visit the image links above and find the logo you would like to use. Add
                    the
                    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag to your page inside the&nbsp;
                    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. Remember that the&nbsp;
                    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag has 2 required attributes.&nbsp;
                    <kbd>alt</kbd>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
                    <kbd>src</kbd>.</p>
                <p>
                    <kbd>src</kbd> should indicate the location of the image and
                    <kbd>alt=""</kbd>&nbsp;should contain a short description about the image and is used primarily for the screen
                    readers that the visually impaired use to browse the web.</p>
                <p class="callout">This image is already the right size and is on a web server, so we just need to figure out what its URL is
                    to add it to our page. Your browser makes it really easy to do that. If you click with the right mouse
                    button on any image in the browser your computer will offer you several actions you can take. The one
                    we are interested in right now is "Copy Image Address".</p>
                <p>Copy the address for the logo image and paste the result into the src attribute in our image. the final tag
                    should look something like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src="http://brothert.net/dryoar/images/dryoarlogo.png" alt="Dry Oar boating logo"&gt;</code></pre>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>You may be wondering what your site looks like. Remember that you can hit the "Show" button anytime to
                        see the results of your work.</p>
                </div>
               
                <div class="callout">
                    <h4>Indentation</h4>
                    <p>You may have noticed something else about my code as well. Notice how I am indenting my HTML elements
                        to help me clearly see which elements are inside of other elements. As your page gets larger this
                        becomes more and more important. Take a little time to keep your code in order...you will be happy
                        you did later on.</p>
                </div>
                
               
               <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 09: Finish the Menu</span>
                </h3>
                <p>Now it's time to add the list of subpages that will eventually become links and provide our site's navigation.</p>
                <p class="callout">Notice that I said 'list' there. One thing most people don't realize is that most navigation bars on most
                    websites are made with an unordered list...the same one you learned how to use in this week's Khan Academy
                    lesson. They are well disguised, but they really are lists.</p>
                <p>The starter code provided already had the start of a list for you. Notice the
                    <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element with two <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> children. Add additional <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements for each link
                    that shows in your siteplan. I would let the
                    <code>aboutme.html</code> link drop to the bottom of the list.</p>



                <p> Your
                    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> should look something like this:</p>

                <pre><code class="html">&lt;header&gt;
 &lt;div class="logo-box"&gt;&lt;img src="http://brothert.net/dryoar/images/dryoarlogo.png" alt="Dry Oar boating logo"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;nav&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       ...the rest of your list...
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</code> </pre>
                <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 10: Add a Banner</span>
                </h3>
                <img class="right" src="../images/2015-11-11_1525.png" alt="Tiny Partial Circle" title="Tiny Partial Circle" />

                <p>Next is a wide banner image. Look through the images provided and choose one to add to your page in the
                    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> we added earlier to hold it. A regular sized image will not work here... it&nbsp;
                    <strong>MUST</strong>&nbsp;be a page wide image. Remember you can see what your site is looking like anytime by
                    hitting the view at the top of the page.</p>
                <p class="clearfix">If your page does not update, click the refresh button (The tiny partial circle by the address line) &nbsp;on
                    the Chrome&nbsp;browser.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 11: Add the Main content</span>
                </h3>

                    
                <p>Next we have a collection of a bunch of headlines paragraphs and images. Start right below the banner in the wireframe (you still have that open right?) and read left to right top to bottom to add the content. <strong>All of these elements will go <em>inside</em> of the <kdb>home-grid</kdb> div.</strong> </p>
                  <p>Using the&nbsp;
                   
                    <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag add the first headline to the page inside of the first
                    <kdb>home-grid</kdb> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.  (There is a headline on the wireframe you can use...or you can make up your own). Give this <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> a name with a <kbd>class</kbd>.  Call it <kbd>home-headline-1</kbd></p>
                    <p> Then use a&nbsp;
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag to add the following text: (or something similar...feel free to edit this :)
                    ) inside of that same
                    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Give it a class as well. Call it <kbd>home-paragraph-1</kbd>
                </p>
                <kbd class="callout">We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar
                    philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty
                    that surrounds the rivers we love.</kbd>
         


            <p>Finally choose another picture from those provided and add it after the paragraph. Add a class to it as well of <kbd>home-right-img</kbd>
               
            <p>Here is an example of how your code should look:</p>

            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;div class="home-grid"&gt; 
    &lt;h2 class="home-headline-1"&gt;We run Rivers to relax.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="home-paragraph-1"&gt;We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing...  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img class="home-right-img" src="http://brothert.net/dryoar/images/river-evening.jpg" alt="peaceful evening shot of a river"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    

        </code>
        </pre>
           <p>Check your work to make sure that everything is showing up correctly. Then add another headline, paragraph, and image. Make sure to use different names for their classes. I would recommend: <kbd>home-headline-2, home-paragraph-2, home-left-img</kbd>. Text for the paragraph is below:</p>
           <kbd class="callout">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness
                that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful
                water that always follows even more.</kbd>
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Using personal images</h4>
                <p>You may be wondering how you might use a picture of your own on a website. It's actually pretty easy. An
                    image needs to be on a webserver in order to be used on a website. Glitch is our webserver, so if you
                    want to add a picture of your own you just need to upload it into Glitch as we did for the About Me activity.
                    You might want to take an early look at the
                    <a href="..//lesson06/optimizing-images.html" target="_blank">Optimizing Images</a> activity before you do this though. </p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>
                <span class="highlight">Step 13: Finishing up the main content</span>
            </h3>
                <p>The next section is a bit different. The headline and paragraph there are going to be kept together when we do our layout. Whenever you want to move multiple elements together you should group them by placing them <em>inside</em> of another element. Let's use a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element for this. Add a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> with a class of <kbd>home-paragraph-3</kbd> then add a headline and paragraph inside of that element like we did above. We don't necessarily have to add classes to this <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> since we will learn how to find them based off of their parent later. But you can add them if you would like. Here is the text for the last paragraph:</p>
            <kbd class="callout">We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing rivers we visit. Check out our trips and let us know
                which one best suits you. We're waiting to hear from you!</kbd>
                <p>And here is what the HTML for this portion of the page should look like.</p>
                <pre><code class="html">
&lt;section class="home-paragraph-3"&gt; 
    &lt;h2&gt;Come Run with us.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing rivers we visit.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;    
        </code>
        </pre>
            <h3>
                <span class="highlight">Step 14: Footer content</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Finally let's add the content to the
                <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. The copyright comes first. Put it into the first element that you should have added
                in your
                <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. To make the copyright symbol we use a special code, there are many of these but we
                will just learn this one today: <kbd>&amp;copy;</kbd> Place that right before the 201X so it will look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 201X Dry Oar&lt;p&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Let's go ahead and add your name and section as part of the footer as well. So the final html for the footer section should
                look something like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 201X Dry Oar - FirstName LastName - Section &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>Make sure to use the current year for the copyright! We will add the icons for the social media links later.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>
                    <strong>One more reminder!</strong> Our only goal is to get all of the content onto the page that is shown on
                    the wireframe. Our Page will
                    <strong>not</strong> look like the wireframe at this point. Each week will get us closer, but our page will not
                    look exactly like the wireframe for several weeks, so patience will be required :)</p>
