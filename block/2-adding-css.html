            <p>Estimated time: 1:30 minutes</p>
            <p>This week we will continue with the webpage we started in the previous activities. Open up the index.html file

                <p>We got all the content in our page last week....but you might of noticed it doesn't look too great. Remember
                    that HTML is responsible to get content on a page, but to style it we use CSS. Make sure you have completed
                    the

                    <h3>Review Wireframe</h3>
                    <p>First review the&nbsp;
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-boxes.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;again to help remember what we are trying to do. Last week we created 'rows' and
                        'columns' with html elements, and then filled them with content. </p>
                    <p>As we added those structural tags last week did you notice anything about them? Whenever possible we
                        tried to use tags that actually described what the content they would hold. This concept of using
                        tags with meaning is called
                        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">semantics</a>. This becomes very important as pages become larger and more complex. </p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Semantics</h4>
                        <p>So how do you know which of the semantic elements you should use when adding or grouping content?
                            or when a simple
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is the right answer? We shouldn't try to make everything a
                            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> (a section is a portion of the page that contains at least a headline, paragraph, and possibly
                            an image that cannot stand on it's own), and html becomes really hard to read when everything
                            is just in a generic
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Here is a
                            <a href="http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png" target="_blank">flowchart</a> that might help. </p>
                        <p>That flowchart talks about using the grouping elements, but what about other tags like &lt;p&gt;
                            or &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;? At the end of the day, writing semantic HTML means that if you need
                            to add a headline to your page you will use a &lt;h2&gt; and not a &lt;p&gt; or a &lt;div&gt;.
                            If you are adding a list of something use a &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; and not a bunch of &lt;p&gt;s.
                            If you do need a paragraph you don't use &lt;h1&gt; or any of it's siblings...even if you want
                            the paragraph to be big! Always use the tag that best describes the content.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Note</h3>
                    <p>At this point do not expect your page to
                        <em>look</em> like the wireframe. We are laying a foundation, but have not learned how to position elements
                        yet. Don't worry if your page does not look like the wireframe at this point.</p>
                    <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Internal links</h3>
                    <p>We added some text in an unordered list last week to be used as links. Right now they are just text,
                        lets fix that. Turn each item in the list into a link by wrapping just the text (not the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>!) in an&nbsp;
                        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                        </a>&nbsp;tag. The&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>tag has one required attribute if you recall from Khan Academy:
                        <kbd>href=""</kbd>. This is where we tell the browser where the link should take us to. These will all
                        be other pages on our site, but they don't exist yet. Let's just put
                        <kbd>index.html</kbd>&nbsp;in there for now. That way the link will work if it's clicked on. We will replace
                        those with actual pages as we build them.</p>
                    <p>Each list item should look something like this:&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
                    </p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>If you recall from the Khan academy lesson from this week links can be used to travel to different
                            pages on the same site, to pages on a different site, and even to different places on the same
                            web page.</p>
                        <p>It is often considered a good practice if you have a link that takes you away from the current site
                            to have it open in a new window or tab. This can be done with the&nbsp;
                            <kbd>target="_blank"</kbd>&nbsp;attribute.</p>

                    <h3>External links</h3>

                    <p>Lets add some external links to social media to our site. Khan Academy taught this week that more than
                        just text can be used to create links. In this case it would be appropriate to make an image the
                        link instead.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Here a some icons (images) for some common social media sites that you can use for this next step.
                            Or you can go find some of your own.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            <img src="../images/icons/color/youtube.png" alt="youtube" title="youtube" />
                            <img src="../images/icons/color/pinterest.png" alt="pinterest" title="pinterest" />
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Select 3 social media sites and create a link to them in the footer of your page using an image. Make
                        sure the link opens in a new window/tab.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>When we added images before we found the URL of the image (right click, copy image address) and used
                            that. In this case it would be better to download the image to our computer and then upload it
                            to our host as part of the site.</p>
                        <p>If you right click on any of the images above you will see an option "Save image as..." Do that.
                            Login to Glitch and click on the Assets folder. Drag each of the files you need into the browser
                            window to upload them to Glitch. Then you can click on the image and click the "Copy URL" button
                            to get what you need to add to the img tag.</p>
                        <p>Glitch has really long image URLs so I would recommend always using the copy functionality.</p>
                        <p>The whole img tag with a src like above would look like this: </p>
                        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/c852da23-70d9-4da6-83eb-4823e3bbe587%2Ffacebook.png?1518559207353" alt="Facebook icon"&gt;

                    <p>We've been doing a lot with HTML so far...and in fact we have now added almost all the html we will need!
                        I think it's high time we got to CSS!</p>
                    <div class="callout">

                    <h3>External Stylesheets</h3>
                    <p>Let's add some styles! The Khan Academy lessons start out by having you add CSS in the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;portion of your page. There is actually a better way, and we are already
                        setup to do it. We will use an external stylesheet instead of the Internal method Khan uses.</p>
                    <p>You may have noticed the line in your HTML that looks like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>You may have also noticed a file in your list called
                        <kbd>styles.css</kbd>. The
                        <kbd>link</kbd> tag tells the html file where to find the CSS it should use to style the page. We will
                        enter all of our CSS in the
                        <kbd>styles.css</kbd> file. If you open up that file you will notice a bit of CSS already written. Let's
                        remove that so that we start with a clean slate.</p>

                    <h3>Adding some color</h3>
                    <p>The wireframe has a rectangle around the navigation menu. This usually indicates a colored box in that
                        area. Let's add some color to our&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>. In the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>styles.css</kbd> file let's make a CSS rule modifying our&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>
                    </p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>CSS Basics</h4>
                        <p>Every CSS rule is made up of 3 elements. First we always need a
                            <strong>selector</strong>, in this case we want to modify any&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements on our page so our selector will be:&nbsp;
                            <kbd>nav</kbd>. Next there are always curly braces { } that form the
                            <strong>declaration block</strong>. Inside those braces we place one or more

                        <p>It's worth taking a moment and talking about what valid options you have to designate color. The
                            3 main ways are hexadecimal, rgb, and predefined color names. Take a moment to visit&nbsp;

                    <p>The color you changed the background of the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;to may have made your text hard to read. In the site plan you should have chosen a color for
                        your links. Add the following line to your css rule to change the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>color</kbd>&nbsp;for the text in the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;. Again replace the color with one from your chosen palette. Pick something that looks good
                        with the background color and that is easily readable.</p>
                    <pre><code class="css">

                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Take a look at your page. Pay particular attention to our new links. Did the color change? Your carefully
                            chosen color is probably still blue or purple! CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. the Cascading
                            part means that you can have more than one set of styles apply to an element, and that they will
                            cascade down with the rules closest to the element taking precedence.</p>
                        <p>We applied a color change at the&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;level, but&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags have some default styling as well and the
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;is closer to the text we want styled than the&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;is so those styles override ours. If we want the links to change back to the color we chose
                            we will need to move our rule closer...override the default styling of the&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;itself most likely. W3Schools has some more info on the idea of&nbsp;

                        <em>Really</em> change the color of your navigation link text by adding a rule with
                        <code>"nav a"</code> as the selector. Then add your
                        <code>color: #whatever your color is;</code> to that rule. (We will learn more about that combo selector in a week or two)</p>
                    <p>Your new css rule should look something like this (change the color to one of your colors)</p>

                    <h3>More background color</h3>
                    <p>Our next step is to add the background color to the second&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;in our page.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>We have a slight problem here though. If we use the tag as a selector like we did with&nbsp;
                            <kbd>&lt;nav&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;it will change both of our sections, which we don't want. From the Khan
                            Academy lesson you should have learned about 2 other selectors: id selectors and class selectors.
                            Id selectors should be used for elements that have unique styling needs, class selectors for
                            those elements that might share styles with other elements. (I tend to use far more class selectors
                            than id, I like re-using CSS rules)
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this case let's use an ID. Add an&nbsp;
                        <kbd>id=""</kbd>&nbsp; attribute to the second section so we can apply some styles just to that one. Pick
                        a descriptive name for the id, then add a rule to change the background color of that box to one
                        of your colors. (Remember that when you write the rule you need to add a '#' to your id name so the
                        browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;
                        <em>id</em>&nbsp;and not the&nbsp;

                    </div>
                    <p>Your section should look something like this (you can call your id anything you want...I chose "top-row")</p>
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;section id="top-row"&gt; ...content of section here... &lt;/section&gt;
        </code> </pre>
                    <p>The corresponding css to style that id would look something like this:</p>

                    <h3>Headline colors</h3>
                    <p>Next let's make our headlines stand out a little more. Lets change the color of all headlines again to
                        one of the colors in your palette. Since we need to make sure everything from&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;-&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;h6&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;gets the same styling we will take advantage of the fact that you can apply
                        the same styles to more than one selector, so we can write one rule instead of six to change them
                        all.
                    </p>
                    <p>To have a set of rules apply to more than one selector we separate them with a comma. So the rule to
                        change the color of all headlines would look something like this:</p>
                    <h2>Multiple selector Example</h2>

                    <h3>Paragraph color</h3>
                    <p>Changing the color of the second section may have made the text there hard to read. For our final step
                        lets use a class selector to change the color of that text. Add a&nbsp;
                        <kbd>class=""</kbd>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;inside the second section. Choose a descriptive name for the class, then create
                        a css rule to change the color. Remember that you need to precede your rule with a '.' so that the
                        browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;
                        <em>class</em>&nbsp;and not a&nbsp;
                        <em>tag</em>. If done correctly it should only change the text of the paragraph we applied the class
                        to.

                        <h4>Block vs Inline</h4>
                        <p> There are two basic types of HTML elements:&nbsp;
                            <em>
                                <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp" target="_blank">Block and Inline</a>
                            </em>.</p>
                        <p>Block elements are greedy. By default they take up 100% of the space they have available, meaning
                            they will not allow any other element to share the line they are on...thus forcing line breaks
                            around themselves. Most of the semantic elements we use for grouping related content fall into
                            the block category, as well as&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, and&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</p>
                        <p>Inline elements like to share. They will allow as many other elements to share the line they are
                            on until it is full...then they wrap. Some examples of inline elements are&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>and plain text</p>
                        <p>Another way to think of this is that block elements (if we are working in a top down, left to right
                            language like english) flow vertically down the page, while inline elements flow horizontally
                            from left to right across the page.</p>

                            this way? Why is the list of links down below the logo? Why does each link show on it's own line?
                            Most importantly, the wireframe shows the links on the same line as the logo and each link in
                            the same line as each other, how can we make them do that? The top of your page should look something
                            like this:</p>
                        <p>(I'm not going to give you the answer to this right now, and you won't be graded on it...yet. But

                        <p>We set the width, but the page still doesn't look right. It would look better if it were centered
                            instead of left aligned. Centering with CSS is not hard, but can be confusing. This is because
                            block and inline elements are centered differently. Block elements are centered by setting a
                            width and adjusting the left and right margin (

                    <h3>Block centering</h3>
                    <p>Let's center our content. The
                        <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> we set the width on is a block element, that means we will need to use
                        <kbd>margin</kbd> to center it. The idea is to set a width (we did this in the last step) Then tell the
                        browser to take whatever margin is available and split it between the left and right of the element.
                        This is a lot easier than it sounds. Add
                        <kbd>margin: 0 auto;</kbd> to the CSS rule for
                        <kbd>#content</kbd>. We gave it 2 values. The first says to set the top and bottom margins to 0 and the
                        second says to set the left and right margins to auto: meaning to split any margin available between
                        the left and right.
                    </p>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Inline Centering</h3>
                    <p>While we are centering let's try an inline element now. On the wireframe the bottom section text is centered.
                        Apply the
                        <kbd>text-align: center;</kbd> style to the bottom section (you should have placed that headline and paragraph
                        in a box earlier). Add a class or id to that box with a meaningful name and use that to apply the
                        style.
                    </p>
