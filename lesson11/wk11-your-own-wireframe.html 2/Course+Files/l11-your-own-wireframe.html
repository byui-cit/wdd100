<h1>Creating Your Own Wireframes</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 45 minutes</p>
<p>Read the entire activity before creating the wireframes</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>We now have a completed web page, but if you review the syllabus, you will remember that our final website should consist of 3 or more pages. We have more work to do!</p>
<p>If you refer back to our site plan, you will remember that there was a site map in there, and in fact we added a full navigation bar to our site with links to pages that currently don't exist. You need to choose 2 of those links that you will now design and make a page for (or if you have other ideas for related pages you could go with those as well). I have put together some Subpage Content on the next page&nbsp;appropriate for each of those pages that you are welcome to use as is or modify, or you can come up with your own content for the page.</p>
<p>The first step when designing is to put together a list of the elements that need to be on the page, then you can prioritize and start arranging those content elements together. This process of arranging is called wireframing. I provided the wireframe for the first page, you will need to create 2 more wireframes now...one for each page.</p>
<p>There are lots of good resources online about wireframing like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginners guide to wireframing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWO2vlBHPvI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube - Creating Wireframes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wireframes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I &hearts; wireframes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a log of good tools on the internet to use for creating wireframes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://moqups.com/">https://moqups.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(a great free site with loads of tools.&nbsp; If you create a free account with your @byui.edu email and let me know, I can send in your info and get you a free education account for as long as you are a student ( or instructor)</li>
<li><a href="https://cacoo.com/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=cacoo+brand+(Ph)&amp;utm_term=cacoo&amp;utm_content=Cacoo+Brand+(Ph)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cacoo.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wireframe.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wireframe.cc</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not&nbsp; want to use one of these tools, you could try <strong>Powerpoint</strong>, <strong>Word</strong>, or <strong>Paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;You essentially just need something that allows you to place boxes and text and move them around easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some designers still <em><strong>start first</strong></em> by sketching on paper for a rough draft...but for this assignment, what you turn in needs to be hi-tech.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you use one of the online tools you can either export your wireframe as an image if it has that option or you could simply <em><strong>take a screenshot</strong></em>.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>To &ldquo;take a screenshot&rdquo; on a PC hit the &ldquo;printscreen&rdquo; button on your keyboard (Sometimes called &ldquo;prt scr&rdquo;, etc) Then you will need to paste it into something (Word for example) save as a .doc or better yet a .jpg or .png to submit.</p>
<p>To take a scene shot on a mac hit CMD-shift-4. Then drag around the area you want the screenshot of. It will create an image file on your desktop.</p>
<p>There are free apps out there that work to take screenshots.&nbsp; Monosnap works great and allow you to use tools to write on the image, put arrows, etc</p>

<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Choose 2 of the subpages from the site map that you will complete this semester along with the home page.</span></p>
<p>Here are a copy of the content and image pages to use while creating your two wireframes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #990000;"><a href="../Course%20Files/Subpage%20Content.html" target="_self" style="color: #990000;">subpage content</a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #990000;"><a href="http://brothert.net/dryoar/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #990000;">images 1</a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #990000;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r9d1gq256pyuwws/AAD7bMbgW0keCVs5ZLUG3sBDa?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #990000;">images 2</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Choose from&nbsp;the provided content and images or come up with your own so that you have a good idea for what needs to be on the page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using&nbsp;one of the tools above (I recommend <span style="color: #990000;"><a href="https://moqups.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #990000;">moqup.com</a></span>) to make a wireframe for your two sub-pages. If you have decided you would rather have different sub pages than you decided on in your site plan, no problem now is the time to change your mind.&nbsp; Just change the two page names in your site plan and in your navigation list and move forward.</span></p>
<p>Each page must include the entire top of your page (from the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; down to the end of the &lt;/header&gt; and the entire footer down to the &lt;/html&gt;.</p>
<p>You must have at least one image besides the logo and banner, enough text for the page to make sense and be able to stand on it&rsquo;s own, and <em>enough of the style elements from the home page </em>that you can tell<em> you are still on the same site</em> (header, footer, navigation, font, colors, etc).</p>
<p class="callout">Since you will be using a hi-tech wireframe, you will use the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>actual content</strong> </em></span>that you will have on the page in the wireframe.&nbsp;This will help you to get the size, shape, and placement of the text correct. For images you can use the actual images you will have on your page.&nbsp; &nbsp;With the actual image, it is often&nbsp;easier to make decisions about size, shape, and placement&nbsp;than with a placeholder image (like you see on the original wireframe.&nbsp; You can choose to use just&nbsp;a placeholder image if you wish, but like any works,&nbsp;it is always better to show a higher level of effort and attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Go to the next page to access "W11.02 Your Own Wireframe" and click "Upload" to upload a word document with your purpose and audience statements.</p>
<h4>Grading:</h4>
This activity will be graded using the following rubric&nbsp; (10 pts for each wireframe) :
<ul>
<li>Two wireframes are produced. Each wireframe includes complete header and footer and at least one image, significant text, and at least one headline.</li>
<li>The wireframes include elements from the home page so the user will feel like they are still on the same site.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
