<h1>Optimization Images</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity Directions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 5 minutes</p>
<p>We love images in websites. They make them more interesting and appealing, they can also make them slow. A typical mobile phone camera will take and image that is over 2000px wide and 1-3MB in size. Just to put that into perspective a typical resolution for a 23" monitor is about 2000px and on a typical cellular connection 2 MB will take 5-10 seconds to download! Imagine taking several such images and placing them in your site...it's load speed would quickly become unacceptable.</p>
<p>We can easily use CSS and adjust the sizes at which those images appear, but the browser will still have to download the whole image before it can shrink it. A better solution is to use an image editing program and <em>change its size</em> to just what we need.</p>
<p>Blaine Robertson has a good tutorial on doing just this on his site: <a href="http://blainerobertson.net/content/?content=485" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Optimizing Images</a>. He uses an online image editor, but you can do this with any image editing program. If you have never resized an image before you should definitely go check it out.</p>
<p>After you are done optimizing your images they should be no larger than they absolutely need to be (refer to your wireframe to get an idea about what that size should be), saved in an appropriate format (usually .jpg for images and .png for logos or icons), and no larger than 100kB except in rare occasions (20-30kB is even better).</p>
