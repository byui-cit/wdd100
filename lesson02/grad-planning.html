<p>We are learning&nbsp;about the importance of planning when building a website. How much more important do you think planning your education is? The university has a Graduation planning tool for you to use to help with this that we are going to dive into this week.</p>
<p>Here are a few resources for you to use while completing this activity.</p>

<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>Login to your MyBYUI page and complete your graduation plan for your chosen major. Once completed take a screen shot and post the image to ILearn.</p>
<p>If you have not yet declared a major then you are considered an Interdisciplinary Studies/University Studies student. You can still complete the assignment.</p>
<p>If you have already completed your graduation plan...then just spend a moment to make sure it is still accurate, then take a screenshot, submit it, and enjoy the extra time you don't have to spend on this activity. :)</p>
