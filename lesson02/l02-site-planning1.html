<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which content you should put on the site it is critical to determine the purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Revenue&nbsp;</strong>Build revenues for your new/existing business or</li>
<li><strong>Share Information&nbsp;</strong>Share corporate or educational information or</li>
<li><strong>Share Opinions&nbsp;</strong>Share opinions on a subject or</li>
<li><strong>Share Personal Interests&nbsp;</strong>Share personal interests with family and friends</li>
</ul>
<p>All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be more than 'My teacher is making me do this.' :)</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>For this class, we will be building a website for a fictional white water rafting business. Imagine that you are the owners of the business and have decided that it is time for you to have an online presence.&nbsp;<strong>Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for the website</strong>. (at least 100 words)</p>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Another important factor to keep in mind when planning a website, is the audience for the site. Remember, that websites are all about content. The purpose helps define what content you should include, and the content should target your specific audience or audiences (websites can have more than one).</p>
<p><strong>Write a statement specifically identifying your target audience</strong>. Try to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation, interests, etc)</li>
<li>What do they want?</li>
<li>What are their needs that aren't being met?</li>
<li>How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)? (at least 100 words)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 03</h3>
<p>Go to the next page to access "Site Planning 01: Purpose and Audience" and click "Upload" to upload a word document with your purpose and audience statements.</p>
