<h1>Setup Software Used In Course</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real website accessible online from the internet.  This, as you will discover in the readings for this week, requires that you have what is know as a host.  Most hosts cost money, but not all.  For this class we will be using a free service called <a href="https://htmldrop.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDrop</a> as our host. You can then use one of several good text editors to write your actual HTML with.  I recommend one called <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> if you don't have another that you like.</p>
<p>There are a few steps we will need to do to get everything setup.</p>
<h3>Step 01&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>HTMLDrop uses Dropbox for the file storage.  If you already have a Dropbox account, and their program setup on your computer and know how to use it, skip to the next step.  If you do not then follow the instructions on <a href="..//resources/dropbox-setup.html" target="_blank">setting up Dropbox</a>, then come back. </p>

<h3>Step 02</h3>
    <p>Goto <a href="https://htmldrop.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDrop.com</a> and sign in with your Dropbox credentials. HTMLDrop will need to create a folder inside your Dropbox folder called "HTMLDrop" and will ask for permission to do this. After granting it permission it will take you to an account screen.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Step 03</h3>
    <p>Next we need to create a domain for you to use. Click on the "Create" button on the right side of the screen. Enter whatever you want to use for your domain.  This does need to be unique, and will only allow letter and numbers. I usually recommend something like "semesterLastnameFirstinitial". So for me it would be "w16thompsond" (if it were Winter 2016).</p>

    <h3>Step 02&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>Download and install <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a>.  </p>

There are 3 videos that range from 3-6 minutes long that will walk you through all of the setup for github. </p>

<p ><em>Starting in Week 4</em>, you will need to submit assignments using Github. Make sure that you watch the videos and do the setup <strong>before</strong> then.</p>
