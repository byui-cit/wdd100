<h1>Setup Software Used In Course</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real website accessible online from the internet.  This, as you will discover in the readings for this week, requires that you have what is know as a host.  Most hosts cost money, but not all.  For this class we will be using a free service called <a href="https://htmldrop.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDrop</a> as our host. You can then use one of several good text editors to write your actual HTML with.  I recommend one called <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> if you don't have another that you like.</p>
<p>There are a few steps we will need to do to get everything setup.</p>
<h3>Step 01&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>HTMLDrop uses Dropbox for the file storage.  If you already have a Dropbox account, <strong>and their desktop program</strong> setup on your computer and know how to use it, skip to the next step.  If you do not then follow the instructions on <a href="../resources/dropbox-setup.html" target="_blank">setting up Dropbox</a>, then come back. </p>

<h3>Step 02</h3>
    <p>Goto <a href="https://htmldrop.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDrop.com</a> and sign in with your Dropbox credentials. HTMLDrop will need to create a folder inside your Dropbox folder called "HTMLDrop" and will ask for permission to do this. After granting it permission it will take you to an account screen.</p>
    <div class="fig-block">

<figcaption><a href="https://htmldrop.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDrop Account screen</a></figcaption>

    </div>
    <h3>Step 03</h3>
    <p>Next we need to create a domain for you to use. Click on the "Create" button on the right side of the screen. Enter whatever you want to use for your domain.  This does need to be unique, and will only allow letter and numbers. I usually recommend something like "semesterLastnameFirstinitial". So for me it would be "w16thompsond" (if it were Winter 2016).</p>

<figure><img alt="HTMLDrop create domain screen"  src="../images/htmldrop-create-domain.jpg" title="HTMLDrop create domain screen" />

    </div>
    
    
    <p>This will form the URL you will turn in for most of your assignments over the course.  You can always find it on the HTMLDrop Account screen if you forget it.</p>
     <div class="fig-block">
    <figure><img alt="HTMLDrop url"  src="../images/htmldrop-your-url.jpg" title="HTMLDrop uRL" />

    </div>
    <div class="callout" >
        <p>When you created your domain in HTMLDrop it automatically created a folder on your computer where you need to place all of your files for you webpages.  In my case the folder is: <code>DropBox/Apps/HTMLDrop/w16thompsond</code>. If you place your files anywhere else your instructor will <strong>not</strong> be able to see them to give you a grade!</p>

    <h3>Step 04&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>Download and install <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a>, then complete the <a href="../resources/brackets-setup.html" target="_blank">Brackets setup</a> instructions.</p>

<p>Here is the complete list of software we will use this semester:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>: Cloud based file storage service.  Great way to backup important files and make them available on any computer.</li>
<li><a href="https://htmldrop.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDrop</a>: Service that works with Dropbox to make it work as a web host.</li>
<li ><a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> (Mac and Windows) Text Editor made specifically for working with HTML and CSS. </li>
<li ><a href="http://wireframe.cc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wireframe.cc</a> Lightweight online tool for creating wireframes.</li>
<li ><a href="https://cacoo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cacoo.com</a> Another online wireframing tool with a larger feature set.</li>
