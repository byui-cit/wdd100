                <strong>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</strong>
            </h2>

            <p>Estimated Time: 15 minutes</p>
            <p>One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real website accessible with a browser.&nbsp; This,
                as you will discover in the readings and videos for this week, requires you to have what is known as a host.&nbsp;
                Most hosts cost money, but not all.&nbsp; For this class, we will be using a free service called
                <strong>
                    <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thimble</a>
                </strong>. Using this service allows you to create your website with their text editor, save the website, upload the
                images for the website, and even share the website with an instructor or fellow student for collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>There are a few steps we will need to go through to get everything set up so you are ready to begin..</p>
            <ol class="bigSteps">

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h2>Thimble Login</h2>
                    <p>Visit the
                        <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thimble</a> website and click on the
                        <strong>Create an Account</strong> link in the top right corner of the screen. Enter a username, valid email,
                        and a password.

                    <h2>'Remix' the Starter project</h2>
                    <p>Next we need to create a&nbsp;project for you to use this semester. Thimble makes use of a concept called
                        a 'Remix'. This is essentially taking an existing Thimble project and making a copy of it that you
                        can use and edit. I have prepared a project for this class that you should 'Remix'. Visit this
                        <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/matkat/483355" target="_blank">Starter Project</a>
                        <strong>AFTER</strong> logging into Thimble and then tap the '
                        <strong>Remix This</strong>' button in the top right corner of the window. This will create a personal copy
                        of it for you that you can edit.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Become familiar with the interface</h2>
                    <p>After remixing the project you should see something similar to the following:</p>
                    <div class="fig-block">
                        <figure>
                            <img alt="Thimble editor" src="../images/thimble-tour.jpg" title="Thimble editor" />

                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>This is the current name of your project. You should change this to something more meaningful by
                            clicking on the name.
                        </li>
                        <li>This is the button to add a new file or folder to your project. Right next to it is a button that
                            will hide the sidebar while you are working to free up more space.</li>
                        <li>This is the list of files in the project. Notice in the image that
                            <code>index.html</code> is selected and open in the editor. If
                            <code>index.html</code> is not open in your screen tap on it to open it.</li>
                        <li>This is the code editor. It is where we will spend most of our time writing HTML and CSS</li>
                        <li>This is where you will see the results of the code you write. It should automatically update when
                            you make changes as long as the green check mark is showing next to the word "Auto" at the top
                            of that pane.</li>
                        <li>This is where you can switch between previewing changes to the current file you are working on and
                            viewing a tutorial where you can find a collection of helpful tips and links from the course.</li>
                        <li>Tap here if you want to see your page in full screen mode.</li>
                        <li>Finally this is where you will tap to "Publish" your work. You
                            <strong>must</strong> publish your site before anyone else can see it. You must also
                            <strong>re-publish</strong> after you've made changes that you want someone (like a classmate or the
                            instructor) to see. You can also find the public link to your site here.</li>

                        For now let's take a look at the page this code created. Make sure that the
                        <code>index.html</code> file is selected in the list of files and look in the Preview window in Thimble. You should see
                        a very basic page with only three links.</p>
