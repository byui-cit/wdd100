            <h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
            <p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
            <p>This week we have two important goals. One to introduce you to HTML, and two to introduce you to each other.
                With this activity we will accomplish both.</p>

                    <p>Let's learn the vocabulary you will need to succeed in this course.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>HTML has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is important that we become familiar
                            with it. Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a
                            hard time making sense of the instruction given in this course if you don't understand these
                            terms.

                            <dd>Elements placed inside of other elements are called nested. Nested Elements are indented to make
                                it easier to see which elements are inside of others.

                            <dd>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed inside of the
                                opening tag. The value of the attribute should be wrapped in quotes. ie

                            </dt>
                            <dd>Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements
                                = elements with a meaning. Writing semantic HTML means using the html tag that best describes
                                the content you are adding to your page.</dd>

                    <p>Let's write some HTML. Open (log into) Glitch, and create a new file called
                        <code>aboutme.html</code>. (It needs to be exactly
                        <code>aboutme.html</code>. No caps, no spaces.) Click on the
                        <code>aboutme.html</code> file and type the HTML below.</p>
                    <p>This code contains everything you need for a basic web page. It has most of the items listed above. Tags,
                        elements, nesting, parent elements, child elements, and semantics. Can you spot them all?</p>

                            find that your ability to write HTML will improve dramatically if you type them all out.</p>

                    <h2>Titles and Headlines</h2>
                    <p>A visitor to a website should not have to guess what the page is about. The &lt;title&gt;&nbsp;says "All
                        About Me". Although you can see "All About Me" looking at the html, it will not show up on the page.&nbsp;
                        This is because &lt;title&gt; is in the &lt;head&gt; section and anything in the &lt;head&gt; is
                        not seen in the browser window.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only items in the &lt;body&gt; section are actually seen
                        on the page. The &lt;title&gt; shows up as the name of the tab or window.</p>
                    <p>We can use a headline element on our page so that when someone visits your page, they will know what
                        your page is about.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>There are various sizes of headlines: &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; These can be used to establish a hierarchy
                            for your page. The
                            <em>smaller</em> the number with the h like &lt;h1&gt; for instance, the
                            <em>larger</em> the text and the more important the headline should be. An &lt;h1&gt; for example
                            should be used for the
                            <em>most important</em> title on the page. You should only use one &lt;h1&gt; on your page.</p>
                        <p>&lt;h2&gt; tags would be the next level and you can use as many as you need. Think about the structure
                            of this course. It is broken up into weeks and activities. An outline using headline elements
                            would look like the following:</p>
                        <div class="outline">
                            <h1>WDD 100 (&lt;h1&gt;)</h1>
                            <h2>Week1 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                            <h3>Software Setup (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                            <h3>Getting to Know you (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                            <h3>Purpose and Audience (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>

                            <h3>Getting Started (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>To let&nbsp;visitors to your page know what it is about at a glance, let's add a larger headline to advertise.&nbsp;Let's
                        use the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag for this. Add a line between the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements and add an&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>opening tag,&nbsp;and type "About Me".&nbsp; Then enter&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;to close the element. Let's add a sub-heading or two as well.&nbsp; Let's use &lt;h2&gt; (smaller
                        text) and put your first name and your nickname if you have one.&nbsp; Do this right after the &lt;h1&gt;
                        About Me&lt;/h1&gt;:

                          design, why you are taking the course, what you hope to get
                          out of it, and how you will use the information in your
                          personal or professional life.

                          of Latter Day Saints?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite quote from
                          one of the leaders of the church?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite
                          scripture?

                      Start with the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) that says "Hello
                      World".&nbsp; Replace that with your own information and wording.
                      Each time you want a new paragraph (please break it into more than
                      one paragraph!) Add a new
                      <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> element.

                    <h2>View your work</h2>
                    <p>
                      When you have finished adding your paragraphs you will want to
                      view your webpage. To do this click on the "Show" button at the
                      top left of the screen. Glitch offers two ways to view your
                      webpage: In a new window and Next to the code. Before you turn in
                      your work you should always check out your page in a new window,
                      but most students prefer working "next to the code" while
                      completing the assignments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Select the "Next to the code" option under show. You will notice
                        that while we are working on the <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> file,
                        Glitch opened the <strong> <kbd>index.html</kbd> </strong> file.
                        You can use the link in the <kbd>index.html</kbd> page to switch pages,
                        but everytime you make a change to the html Glitch will switch
                        back to index! Let's tell it to always show us the
                        <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> instead. Tap on the "Change URL" button in
                        the pane that shows your webpage. In the box type
                        <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd>. Now everytime Glitch refreshes the page
                        it will stay on the page we are currently working on!

                    <p>Look's good, but it is a little plain.&nbsp;Let's add an image to dress up your page.</p>

                    <p>Before you can put an image on your web page, you have to get it onto a web server. Lucky for us Glitch
                        makes this easy. We simply need to upload the image from your computer to your assets folder in Glitch.
                        Click on the assets link and then drag and drop your image to the assets page.&nbsp; Then to put
                        the image on your page, click on the image and then click on the"copy url" button.&nbsp; That puts
                        the image link on your clipboard so that you can paste it into the image tag:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <div class="fig-block">
                        <figure>

                    </div>

                    <p>Put your image right after the &lt;h1&gt; line. You will start with the
                        <code>img</code> tag. Images require additional information in order to work however. We have to tell the browser
                        where to find the image. We can use an "attribute" for this. (Remember
                        <strong>attribute</strong> was one of the vocabulary above. If you have forgotten what it is go review).
                        The attribute we need is
                        <code>src=""</code>. Add this right after the word
                        <code>img</code>. So it will look like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src=""&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>Paste the URL you copied for your image into the "" after the
                        <code>src</code>. The final tag should look something like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;img alt="image of me" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/3de58351-6a1f-4d05-80fc-6813c05f9c98%2Ffemaleicon.png"&gt;
        </code></pre>
                    <p>Notice that I snuck an extra attribute in on you:
                        <strong>
                            <code>alt</code>
                        </strong>. The
                        <code>alt</code> attribute should contain a short description of the image. It is shown if the browser can't find
                        the image or it is read for visually impaired visitors to your site.
                        <strong>All</strong> of your images should have an
                        <code>alt</code> attribute. If a tag has multiple attributes, the order of the attributes does not matter.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: left;">There, that looks great.... you coded a web page about yourself that is simple, informative, and has
