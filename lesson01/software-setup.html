            <hr />
            <h2>
                <strong>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</strong>
            </h2>

            <p>Estimated Time: 15 minutes</p>
            <p>One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real website accessible with a browser.&nbsp; This,
                as you will discover in the readings and videos for this week, requires you to have what is known as a host.&nbsp;
                Most hosts cost money, but not all.&nbsp; For this class, we will be using a free service called
                <strong>
                    <a href="https://glitch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitch.com</a>
                </strong>. Using this service allows you to create your website with their text editor, save the website, upload the
                images for the website, and even share the website with an instructor or fellow student for collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>There are a few steps we will need to go through to get everything set up so you are ready to begin..</p>
            <h2>
                <strong>Step 01</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>Visit the
                <a href="https://glitch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitch</a> website and click on the
                <strong>Sign in</strong> button in the top right corner of the screen. Glitch lets you sign in using either facebook
                or GitHub (I like GitHub and use that one)... both are free to use. (If you choose to use GitHub, you would
                need to have a github account). Click on the Sign in button for the account you would like to use. You may
                see a screen requesting permission for Glitch to access the account you have chosen to use.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 02</h2>
            <p>Next we need to create a&nbsp;project for you to use this semester. Glitch makes use of a concept called a 'Remix'.
                This is essentially taking an existing Glitch project and making a copy of it that you can use and edit.
                I have prepared a project for this class that you should 'Remix'. Visit this
                <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wdd100-starter?path=README.md:1:0" target="_blank">Starter Project</a> after logging into Glitch and then tap the 'Remix This' button in the top right corner
                of the window. This will create a personal copy of it for you.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                    <img alt="Glitch create new project" src="../images/glitch-remix.jpg" title="Glitch create new project" />
                    <figcaption>Create a New Project</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <h2>Step 03</h2>
            <p>After creating a project you should see something similar to the following:</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                    <img alt="Glitch editor" src="../images/glitch-project-tour.jpeg" title="Glitch editor" />
                    <figcaption>Create a New Project</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>This is the random name that Glitch chose for your project. You can change this by clicking on the name.
                </li>
                <li>This is the list of files in the project. Notice in the image that
                    <code>index.html</code> is selected and open in the editor. If
                    <code>index.html</code> is not open in your screen tap on it to open it.</li>
                <li>This is the code editor. It is where we will spend most of our time writing HTML and CSS</li>
                <li>This is where you will click to preview your page. It will open a new tab where you can see the results of
                    the code you write.</li>
                <li>This is where you can add a new file to your project.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>Below is the HTML code that is currently in the
                <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;WDD 100&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- logo will go here --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>It's ok if this doesn't make sense yet. We will eventually learn about what each line in this code does. For
                now let's take a look at the page this code created. Click on the "Show" button. You should see a very basic
                page with only two links.</p>
            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            <p>Let's make one more change to the Glitch settings. In the top right corner of the screen there are two icons.
                The far right one let's you see some information about Glitch...it usually looks like a fish. The other is
                for some User options. Click on that one. You should see something similar to the image below. Uncheck "Refresh
                App", and check "Wrap Text"</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                    <img alt="Glitch settings" src="../images/glitch-settings.png" title="Glitch settings" />
                    <figcaption>Change default settings</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>You can also change Glitch to use a dark theme instead of the light one from that menu as well if you prefer
                that.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>You may be asking yourself 'Why would I turn off Refresh App on changes?'. It seems like that would be a
                    nice thing. The problem with the Glitch auto-refresh is that it automatically switches back to
                    <code>index.html</code>
                    <em>every time you make a change!</em>. So if you are working on the
                    <code>aboutme.html</code> file (which you will be doing soon), if you leave auto-refresh on then it will keep switching back to
                    the
                    <code>index.html</code> page, and you will have to click on the "About Me" link to get back to the page you were working on.
                    Major pain.</p>
                <p>Instead to see your changes I recommend just using the Refresh button on your browser.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Step 6</h2>
            <p>Lets practice writing a little HTML of our own now. The starter project includes a file called
                <code>aboutme.html</code>. Tap on that file to open it, then visit the
                <a href="aboutme.html">Getting to know you activity</a> for the rest of the instructions and requirements for this activity.</p>


            <h2>
                <strong>Other Software</strong>
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Here is a list of other software we will use this semester. These are all web based and require no installation.
                    Some would require account creation. Your instructor will give you more details when it is time to use
                    them: </p>
