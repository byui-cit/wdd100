<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<h3>Step 01&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Review and download the program below:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>&nbsp;- You will need to download this software (if you do not already have it installed). It is free.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.handcraft.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Handcraft</a>&nbsp;- This is the online tool that you will use to create and host your website. &nbsp;This tool <em>requires</em> the use of the Google Chrome Web Browser. &nbsp;You will need to make sure you use this browser to build your website. &nbsp;You may want to save it as a favorite or bookmark it so you can find it more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p ><em>Starting in Week 4</em>, you will need to submit assignments using Handcraft. To do this, you will need a Gmail account. If you don't already have a Gmail account, please follow these <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">steps to set up a Gmail account</a>.</p>
<p>Later in the semester we will be making wireframes.  Here are a couple of tools that can be helpful with that.</p>
<ul>
<li ><a href="http://wireframe.cc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wireframe.cc</a> Lightweight online tool for creating wireframes.</li>
<li ><a href="https://cacoo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cacoo.com</a> Another online wireframing tool with a larger feature set.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Check the box below after completing this activity.</p>
<!--<div class="callout">
<p >We recommend Handcraft for this class for the simplicity of having the free editor also be the free host (the host is the web server that makes your site available online). If you have another way to host your files you are welcome to use it instead. The class requirement is that the page is visible online. we don't really care how or where.</p>
    <p >One of the wonderful things about creating web pages is that you really don't need special software to do it. All computers come with the basic tool you need...a basic text editor. Having said that however, there are definately tools that can make your life easier that are free, easy to get and setup. If you have your own hosting and you would like to try something different, listed below are some good tools if you choose not to use Handcraft. <strong>If you have no idea what this is talking about...just use Handcraft ;)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li ><a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> (Mac and Windows) Text Editor made specifically for working with HTML and CSS. </li>
<li ><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TextWrangler</a> (Mac) Good general purpose text editor for the Mac.</li>
<li ><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.3.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> (Windows) Good general purpose text editor for the PC.</li>
<li ><a href="http://wireframe.cc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wireframe.cc</a> Lightweight online tool for creating wireframes.</li>
