 <h1>Setup Software Used In Course</h1>
            <hr />
            <h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
            <p>One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real website accessible online from the internet. This, as you will discover in the readings for this week, requires that you have what is know as a host. Most hosts cost money, but not all. For this class we will be using a free service called <a href="https://updog.co/" target="_blank">Updog</a> as our host. You can then use one of several good text editors to write your actual HTML with. I recommend one called <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> if you don't have another that you like.</p>
            <p>There are a few steps we will need to do to get everything setup.</p>
            <h3>Step 01&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>Updog uses Dropbox for the file storage. If you already have a Dropbox account, <strong>and their desktop program</strong> setup on your computer and know how to use it, skip to the next step. If you do not then follow the instructions on <a href="../resources/dropbox-setup.html" target="_blank">setting up Dropbox</a>, then come back. </p>

            <h3>Step 02</h3>
            <p>Goto <a href="https://updog.co/" target="_blank">updog.co</a> and sign in with your Dropbox credentials. Updog will need to create a folder inside your Dropbox folder called "Updog" and will ask for permission to do this. After granting it permission it will take you to a getting started screen.</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure><img alt="Updog getting started" src="../images/updog-get-started.jpg" title="Updog getting started screen" />
                    <figcaption><a href="https://updog.co/" target="_blank">Updog getting started</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 03</h3>
            <p>Next we need to create a domain for you to use. Click on the "Create New Site" button on the top left side of the screen. Enter whatever you want to use for your domain. This does need to be unique, and will only allow letter and numbers. I usually recommend something like "semesterLastnameFirstinitial". So for me it would be "w17thompsond" (if it were Winter 2017). Leave the second box empty.</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure><img alt="Updog create domain screen" src="../images/updog-create-domain.jpg" title="Updog create domain screen" />
                    <figcaption>Updog Create Domain</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>


            <p>This will form the URL you will turn in for most of your assignments over the course. The URL will be your site(folder) name + updog.co.  So for my example my URL would be: <code>https://w17thompsond.updog.co</code> You can always find it if you login to Updog and click on the Site name if you forget it.</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure><img alt="Updog url" src="../images/updog-your-url.jpg" title="Updog uRL" />
                    <figcaption>Your personal Updog URL (domain)</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>When you created your domain in Updog it automatically created a folder on your computer where you need to place all of your files for you webpages. In my case the folder is: <code>DropBox/Apps/Updog/w17thompsond</code>. If you place your files anywhere else your instructor will <strong>not</strong> be able to see them to give you a grade!</p>
                <h3>Attention!</h3>
                <p>If you don't see an Apps/Updog folder in your Dropbox then something went wrong. Try removing the Site you just created and try again.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 04&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>Download and install <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a>, then complete the <a href="../resources/brackets-setup-updog.html" target="_blank">Brackets setup</a> instructions.</p>
