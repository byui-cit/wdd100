<h1>Setup Software Used In Course</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real website accessible online from the internet.  This, as you will discover in the readings for this week, requires that you have what is know as a host.  Most hosts cost money, but not all.  For this class we will be using a service called <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">github pages</a> as our host. You can then use one of several good text editors to write your actual HTML with.  I recommend one called <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> if you don't have another that you like.</p>
<p>There are a few steps we will need to do to get everything setup.</p>
<h3>Step 01&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Watch and follow the instructions in the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlFq0vVN--w&list=PL4fQkSf0Ec5obQZFSdZ1hixFxAlbXIQjf&index=1" target="_blank">youtube videos</a> by Brother Robertson. There are 3 videos that range from 3-6 minutes long that will walk you through all of the setup for github. </p>

<p ><em>Starting in Week 4</em>, you will need to submit assignments using Github. Make sure that you watch the videos and do the setup <strong>before</strong> then.</p>
<p>With the link below download and install Brackets.  There are also links to a couple of services we will use later in the semester for making wireframes.</p>
<ul>
<li ><a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a> (Mac and Windows) Text Editor made specifically for working with HTML and CSS. </li>
<li ><a href="http://wireframe.cc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wireframe.cc</a> Lightweight online tool for creating wireframes.</li>
<li ><a href="https://cacoo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cacoo.com</a> Another online wireframing tool with a larger feature set.</li>
</ul>
