<h1>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h1>
<hr>
<p>Welcome to Web Design 100! This class serves as an introduction to Web design and development. The course is designed to introduce students to basics of Web technology, Web design and development principles. The course uses hands-on activities with students actually participating in simple Web design projects and programming. It is anticipated that students who complete this course will understand the fields of Web design and development and will have a good idea of whether or not they want to pursue Web design and development as a career.</p>
<h2>Time Consumption</h2>
<p>Remember, because this is a one-credit course, you will spend approximately 3-4 hours each week doing the homework. Do not plan otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself. Set aside time throughout the week to complete your assignments.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p><em>There is no textbook for this course. </em>However, because many of the readings and assignments are online, students are recommended to have a steady internet connection.</p>

<h2>Required Software</h2>
<p>To participate in the class, students will use an online website builder called Handcraft.com. This tool requires the use of the Google Chrome Web Browser. This browser is free and must be downloaded prior to using this tool. There is a page in the introduction week that provides a link to this program.</p>
