            <h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Step 01</h3>
            <p>Goto <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and create an account if you do not have one. After creating the account it should ask you to download their desktop app. We will need that.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>If you already have a Dropbox account but just need the application installed on your computer then click on your username in the top left corner and choose 'install'</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Step 02</h3>
            <p>Install the application. It will create a folder on your computer called Dropbox. Anything you place in that folder will automatically get backed up to their servers when you are connected to the internet. The app will give you a button to click to open that folder when it is done.</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure><img alt="Dropbox app installed" src="../images/dropbox-installed.png" title="Dropbox app installed" />
                    <figcaption>Dropbox installed</figcaption>

            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>So how can you find your Dropbox folder later after you have closed that install window? Dropbox tries to make it easy for you to find your Dropbox folder. When you installed it, a system tray or menu bar icon was added to your computer to help you. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/141?path=desktop_client_and_web_app" target="_blank">What is a system tray or menu icon</a>? you may ask. Follow that link and it will show you. Short answer...on the Mac the menu bar is at the top right of the screen, on Windows the system tray in in the bottom right. In both cases you are looking for the Dropbox 'box' icon. Right click on it and there is an option to open your folder.</p>
