<h1>Setup Brackets</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Brackets is an editor designed specifically for writing HTML and CSS.  Setting it up is fairly simple...but there are a few steps you should do after installation </p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>

<p>If you haven’t already, download and install Brackets. <a href="http://brackets.io" target="_blank">http://brackets.io</a>
</p>

<h3>Step 02</h3>
    <p>When you first launch Brackets it will have an example site open.  You should see something like this: </p>
    <div class="fig-block">
<figure><img alt="HTMLDrop account screen"  src="../images/brackets-first-open.jpg" title="Brackets default opening" />
<figcaption>Brackets-first time launching</figcaption>
</figure>
    </div>
    <p>Notice the "Getting Started" text.  This is the currently open project. You need to change this to your updog Folder. Click on the Getting Started, then "Open Folder".  In the Search box at the top of the Open Dialog type "updog". You should see your updog folder show up...click on it to open it.  Now you should see a folder with the name that you cose for your URL during the <a href="../lesson01/software-setup-dropbox.html" target="_blank">software setup</a> activity.  If you don't see a folder go back and do that again. Select the folder then click "open".</p>
    <div class="callout" >
        <p>Make sure when you are working that you always see your folder name in Brackets. As long as you have your project open all your files will save in the right place. If you place your files anywhere else (Path should be something like <code>DropBox/Apps/updog/w17thompsond</code>) your instructor will <strong>not</strong> be able to see them to give you a grade!</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Step 03</h3>
    <p>Create a new file by clicking File->New or pressing cmd-N on the mac. Ctrl-N on the PC. Save your file as "index.html". All lowercase! </p>
    
<!--
    <div class="fig-block">
<figure><img alt="HTMLDrop create domain screen"  src="../images/htmldrop-create-domain.jpg" title="HTMLDrop create domain screen" />
<figcaption>HTMLDrop Create Domain</figcaption>
</figure>
    </div>
-->
    <h3>Step 04</h3>
    <p>You can now start entering your html.  Could look something like below:</p>
<pre><code class="html">
&lt;!-- HTML - File Name: "index.html" --&gt;
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;My first website&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Step 05</h3>
    <p>If you have Chrome installed on your computer you can click on the Live Preview button on the right side of the edit window and it will bring your page up in that browser for you to see.  As long as you don’t have any errors in your html it should update real-time as you make changes. If you don’t have Chrome installed, open the folder that contains the html file and right click->Open with and select your preferred browser.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 06</h3>
    <p>Open a new window/tab in your browser and enter the HTMLDrop URL in. For me this would be <code>https://w17thompsond.updog.co</code>.  You should see the same thing there that you did when you previewed in Brackets. That is the URL you will turn in for your assignments.</p>
