<h1>Creating a Site Plan</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
<h3>What is a Site Plan?</h3>
<p>Developing a a site plan is a critical step in any web design process. Site plans help establish the purpose of the site, the voice, and overall look and feel...and then they help you apply those consistently across your site.</p>
<p>Site plans come in many shapes and sizes, and level of detail. Here is a list of common elements in a site plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
<li>Definition of audience</li>
<li>personas and scenarios - Who will use the site and how will they use it?</li>
<li>A Style guide:
<ul>
<li>Branding information - how to use the branding for the site correctly</li>
<li>Typography choices and justification</li>
<li>Color palette</li>
<li>Specific styling of elements on the site...ie headings, lists, paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, etc</li>
<li>A site map</li>
<li>Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will focus on the sections for Purpose, audience and a partial style guide. Since the style guide will be the largest portion lets take a look at a few examples to get a better idea about how they are put together.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>FamilySearch</h4>
<div class="fig-block">
<figure><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="Family Search Home" height="239" src="../images/familysearch.jpg" title="familysearch Home" width="388" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://familysearch.com/" target="_blank">FamilySearch Home</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><a href="https://familysearch.org/reference/styleguide/" target="_blank"><img alt="FamilySearch Style Guide" height="239" src="../images/familysearch-style.jpg" title="familysearch Style Guide" width="369" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="https://familysearch.org/reference/styleguide/" target="_blank">FamilySearch Style Guide</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>FamilySearch has a nice styleguide viewable by anyone.  Notice how many colors they use! As you browse around the actual site do you think it's too many or does it work?  Notice that they also have a section about font sizes and paragraph and headline styling, but it never really mentions which fonts they use.</p>
<p>Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site. Does the site accomplish the purpose well and cater to it's audience?</p>
<h4>A List Apart</h4>
<div class="fig-block">
<figure><a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="A List Apart Home" height="215" src="../images/alistapart.jpg" title="A List Apart Home" width="393" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart Home</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><a href="http://patterns.alistapart.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="A List Apart Style Guide" height="215" src="../images/alistapart-style.jpg" title="A List Apart Style Guide" width="389" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://patterns.alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart Style Guide</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A List Apart is a website by web designers for web designers. Much of it's content comes from guest authors so having a well defined style guide is essential to keep everything consistent. The different fonts and colors are clearly defined, then it defines the styling for the many different elements you might find in an article...it even includes example html!</p>

<h3>Uber</h3>
<div class="fig-block">
<figure><a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="Uber Home" height="239" src="../images/uber.jpg" title="Uber Home" width="388" /></a>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Uber put a lot of work into their style guide...lots of imagery and animation, at the core though it is still about outlining how the pages of the site should look.</p>

<h4>Skype</h4>
<div class="fig-block">
<figure><a href="http://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank"><img alt="Skype Home" height="223" src="../images/skype.jpg" title="Skype Home" width="381" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype Home</a></figcaption>

<figcaption><a href="https://issuu.com/bondo/docs/skype_brand_book_-_look" target="_blank">Skype Style Guide</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The style guide here is a bit out of date now. If you look at the current Skype site you still see many of the elements, but not all. The clouds in particular are almost gone now. This is still a great example of a Style/Branding guide that is actually fun to read!</p>

<h2>Activity Directions</h2>
<p>All of those examples were much bigger and more complex than what we will do for our site. I have prepared a template that you should use as a starting point for this activity. You will be building the Dry Oar site. You can use it as it is and just complete it or get as creative as you choose to make a great White Water Rafting site.</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
    <p>Grab the template for the <a href="../resources/NewDryOarSitePlan.docx" >site plan here</a>.</p>
    <p>You will be typing directly on the template so you will make the changes on each page.  You will notice that there are directions on each page in red.  As you complete each section of the site plan, remove the directions and adjust the content on each page so that it begins at the top of the page as you move to the next page.  When you are finished with your site plan, there will be no red directions on the pages (except for the wireframe directions on the last page).  </p>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Take the purpose statement and audience definition that you prepared last week and place them into the appropriate place in the document.</p>
<h2>Color</h2>

<div class="callout">
<p>Color plays an essential role in any website and so the colors you use should be chosen deliberately. There are volumes of material on color theory that can help with these choices.</p>
<p>To learn more about color theory try these sites</p>
<ul>

</ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Step 03</h3>
 <p>Visit <a href="https://coolors.co/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coolers.co</a> and keeping your site purpose and audience in mind build a color scheme using it. Start by thinking of a color you like or think will work well for your site.</p>

<h3>Step 04</h3>
    <p>You will see 5 color stripes. Each color has 4 items on that show when you hover over them: Alternative Shades, drag, adjust, and lock. Play around with one color until you end up a something like you imagined above...<strong>then lock it</strong>. Hit the space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary color schemes for the color you chose.  Feel free to lock other colors and generate until you end up with 3-5 colors you like.</p>
<div class="right"><img src="../images/coolors-hexcode.png" alt="" title="colorscheme"  /></div>
<h3>Step 05</h3>
<p>Once you have built your palette note that at the bottom of each color column there is a 6 digit "number". This is what is known as a hexadecimal color code and is usually preceded by a "#". These codes are the most common way to represent colors on the web. Copy that code into the Site plan document. Place the color you want to use the most often as the primary.</p>

<h3>Step 06</h3>
<div class="right"><img src="../images/exportcolors.jpg" alt="" title="Pallete2" width="211" height="152" /></div>
<p>Then click the "Export" link in the top right corner. This will open a new window with your palette. Click on the PNG box to save a picture of your colors to your desktop. This will make an image that you can drag into your Site Plan on the Color page to replace the placeholder image. You will also want to save your chosen palette URL from coolers.co in case you need to make any changes later.</p>
<h2>Font</h2>

<p>It's time now to choose a font or fonts that you will use for your site. Along with the colors you choose, fonts have the next largest (or maybe even larger in some cases) impact on the look and feel of your site.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the main font you use (the one that most of the text is in) is very readable.</li>
<li>It is OK, and often desirable to have more than 1 font on a page, but if you use more than 2 make sure you have a good reason for it.</li>
<li>If you use 2 fonts make sure there is good contrast between them...ie make sure they are different enough that they will never be mistaken for the same font. A common pattern is to have a very readable font from one font-family (serif, san-serif, script, monospace, fantasy) for all the body copy, and a font from another family for the titles and headlines.</li>
<li>While you should usually sacrifice creativeness for readability for body copy, you can usually get away with something more fun for headlines. They are usually larger in size and only a few words in length, so feel free to experiment a bit more here.</li>
<li>For a page that loads very quickly you should stick with web-safe fonts. These are fonts that can be found on every computer. (Not all fonts are on every computer.) A list can be found on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
<li>Google has a <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">large list of Fonts</a> that can be used on websites as well. Using them will add a small amount of time to the speed at which the page loads...but often it is worth it to get the right font.</li>
<li>Here are a couple of links to articles with more great tips.
    <ul>
<li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/choosing-the-right-font-a-practical-guide-to-typography-on-the-web--webdesign-15" target="_blank">Tutsplus: Choosing the right font</a></li>
<li style="list-style: none;"></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/what-font-should-i-use-five-principles-for-choosing-and-using-typefaces/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine: What font should I use?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Step 07</h3>
<p>Choose one or two fonts to use for the site and record them along with your <i>reasoning for choosing</i> them in the Site Plan.</p>
<h3>Step 08</h3>
<p>Finally from your <em>color palette</em> choose the colors you would like to use for your navigational links (normal, hover, active, and visited) and enter those colors. You should also describe your navigation styles with an image or text.  If you would like specific styling for other links on the pages you can provide those on the Links section under HTML elements. </p>
<p>The Site plan also contains 2 more sections that are complete. A site map and a wireframe. These act like blueprints to help you know how the site should be structured and what it will look like. Review both now. In the following weeks you will use the wireframe provided to help you to create the home page for the site. Even later in the semester you will choose 2 additional pages from the site map, create wireframes for them, and build them as well.</p>
<h3>Step 09</h3>
