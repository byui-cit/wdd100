<h1>Creating a Site Plan</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
<h3>What is a Site Plan?</h3>
<p>Developing a a site plan is a critical step in any web design process. Site plans help establish the purpose of the site, the voice, and overall look and feel...and then they help you apply those consistently across your site.</p>
<p>Site plans come in many shapes and sizes, and level of detail. Here is a list of common elements in a site plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
<li>Definition of audience</li>
<li>personas and scenarios - Who will use the site and how will they use it?</li>
<li>A Style guide:
<ul>
<li>Branding information - how to use the branding for the site correctly</li>
<li>Typography choices and justification</li>
<li>Color palette</li>
<li>Specific styling of elements on the site...ie headings, lists, paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, etc</li>
<li>A site map</li>
<li>Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will focus on the sections for Purpose, audience and a partial style guide. Since the style guide will be the largest portion lets take a look at a few examples to get a better idea about how they are put together.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>A List Apart</h4>
<div class="fig-block">
<figure><a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="A List Apart Home" height="215" src="../images/alistapart.jpg" title="A List Apart Home" width="393" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart Home</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><a href="http://patterns.alistapart.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="A List Apart Style Guide" height="215" src="../images/alistapart-style.jpg" title="A List Apart Style Guide" width="389" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://patterns.alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart Style Guide</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A List Apart is a website by web designers for web designers. Much of it's content comes from guest authors so having a well defined style guide is essential to keep everything consistent. The different fonts and colors are clearly defined, then it defines the styling for the many different elements you might find in an article...it even includes example html!</p>
<p>Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site. Does the site accomplish the purpose well and cater to it's audience?</p>
<h3>Uber</h3>
<div class="fig-block">
<figure><a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="Uber Home" height="239" src="../images/uber.jpg" title="Uber Home" width="388" /></a>
<figcaption><a href="http://uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber Home</a></figcaption>

</div>
<p>Uber put a lot of work into their style guide...lots of imagery and animation, at the core though it is still about outlining how the pages of the site should look.</p>

<h3>Skype</h3>
<div class="fig-block">

</div>
<p>The style guide here is a bit out of date now. If you look at the current Skype site you still see many of the elements, but not all. The clouds in particular are almost gone now. This is still a great example of a Style/Branding guide that is actually fun to read!</p>

<h2>Activity Directions</h2>
<p>All of those examples were much bigger and more complex than what we will do for our site. I have prepared a template that you should use as a starting point for this activity. You will be building the Dry Oar site. You can use it as it is and just complete it or get as creative as you choose to make a great White Water Rafting site.</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>Grab the template for the <a href="../reources/DryOarSitePlan.docx" target="_blank">site plan</a> here.</p>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Take the purpose statement and audience definition that you prepared last week and place them into the appropriate place in the document.</p>
<h3>Step 03</h3>
<p>Complete the Choose your color activity and place your palette information into the plan</p>
<h3>Step 04</h3>
<p>It's time now to choose a font or fonts that you will use for your site. Along with the colors you choose, fonts have the next largest (or maybe even larger in some cases) impact on the look and feel of your site. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the main font you use (the one that most of the text is in) is very readable.</li>
<li>It is OK, and often desirable to have more than 1 font on a page, but if you use more than 2 make sure you have a good reason for it.</li>
<li>If you use 2 fonts make sure there is good contrast between them...ie make sure they are different enough that they will never be mistaken for the same font. A common pattern is to have a very readable font from one font-family (serif, san-serif, script, monospace, fantasy) for all the body copy, and a font from another family for the titles and headlines.</li>
<li>While you should usually sacrifice creativeness for readability for body copy, you can usually get away with something more fun for headlines. They are usually larger in size and only a few words in length, so feel free to experiment a bit more here.</li>
<li>For a page that loads very quickly you should stick with web-safe fonts. These are fonts that can be found on every computer. (Not all fonts are on every computer.) A list can be found on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
<li>Google has a <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">large list of Fonts</a> that can be used on websites as well. Using them will add a small amount of time to the speed at which the page loads...but often it is worth it to get the right font.</li>
<li style="list-style: none;"></li>
<li>Here are a couple of links to articles with more great tips.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/choosing-the-right-font-a-practical-guide-to-typography-on-the-web--webdesign-15" target="_blank">Tutsplus: Choosing the right font</a></li>
<li style="list-style: none;"></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/what-font-should-i-use-five-principles-for-choosing-and-using-typefaces/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine: What font should I use?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose one or two fonts to use for the site and record them along with your <i>reasoning for choosing</i> them in the Site Plan.</p>
<h3>Step 05</h3>
<p>Finally from your <em>color palette</em> choose the colors you would like to use for your navigational links.</p>
<p>The Site plan also contains 2 more sections that are complete. A site map and a wireframe. These act like blueprints to help you know how the site should be structured and what it will look like. Review both now. In the following weeks you will use the wireframe provided to help you to create the home page for the site. Even later in the semester you will choose 2 additional pages from the site map, create wireframes for them, and build them as well.</p>
