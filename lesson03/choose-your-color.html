<h1>Choose Your Colors</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 15 minutes</p>
<p>Color plays an essential role in any website and so the colors you use should be chosen deliberately. There are volumes of material on color theory that can help with these choices.</p>
<p>To learn more about color theory try these sites</p>

</ul>
<p>There are also some great tools available to help in developing good color schemes. One is coolers.co. Visit <a href="https://coolors.co/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coolers.co</a> and keeping your site purpose and audience in mind build a color scheme using it.</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
Start by choosing a color you like or think will work well for your site.

<h3>Step 02</h3>
    <p>You will see 5 color stripes. Each color has 4 items on that show when you hover over them: Alternative Shades, drag, adjust, and lock. Play around with one color until you end up a color you like...<strong>then lock it</strong>. Hit the space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary color schemes for the color you chose.  Feel free to lock other colors and generate until you end up with 3-5 colors you like.</p>

<h3>Step 03</h3>
<p>Once you have built your palette note that at the bottom of each color column there is a 6 digit "number". This is what is known as a hexadecimal color code and is usually preceded by a "#". These codes are the most common way to represent colors on the web. Copy that code into the Site plan document. Place the color you want to use the most often as the primary.</p>

<h3>Step 04</h3>
<div class="right"><img src="../images/exportcolors.jpg" alt="" title="Pallete2" width="211" height="152" /></div>
<p>Then click the "Export" link in the top right corner. This will open a new window with your palette. Click on the PNG box to save a picture of your colors to your desktop. This will make an image that you can drag into your Site Plan on the Color page to replace the placeholder image. You will also want to save your chosen palette in coolers.co for later in case you need to make any changes later.</p>
